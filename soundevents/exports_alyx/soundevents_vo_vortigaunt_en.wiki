|06_00001
|-
|You received my messages!
|06_00002
|-
|Come! Enter.
|06_00003
|-
|You are welcome!
|06_00004
|-
|Cooking!
|06_00005
|-
|I have a brain injury.
|06_00006
|-
|My brain is injured!
|06_00007
|-
|Ow.
|06_00008
|-
|The
|06_00009
|-
|Eli Vance!
|06_00010
|-
|Yes.
|06_00011
|-
|The Combine. Yes. Do not go yet! I must show you something!
|06_00012
|-
|This way!
|06_00013
|-
|It is important!
|06_00014
|-
|The Alyx Vance must go this way anyway
|06_00015
|-
|The Combine have other of my kin.
|06_00016
|-
|Held, like the Eli Vance.
|06_00017
|-
|The Alyx Vance will free them!
|06_00018
|-
|You will not save him. He is dead.
|06_00019
|-
|Or he will be
|06_00020
|-
|It is a matter of perspective. But Alyx Vance alone cannot prevent his fate.
|06_00021
|-
|No riddles! The Combine drilled here. I do not know when I am. I am severed from the Vortessence. I am alone in my head.
|06_00022
|-
|You have saved my kin!
|06_00023
|-
|Then you will! Courage, Alyx Vance!
|06_00024
|-
|I will help the Alyx Vance! Look to the Northern Star.
|06_00025
|-
|For guidance!
|06_00026
|-
|I am not! Here.
|06_00027
|-
|Sustenance!
|06_00028
|-
|You will be welcome.
|06_00029
|-
|Come in, come in!
|06_00030
|-
|Enter, Alyx Vance.
|06_00031
|-
|Your journey brings you this far. Just a little farther, perhaps.
|06_00032
|-
|I have been waiting for you, Alyx Vance.
|06_00033
|-
|In here!
|06_00034
|-
|I must show you why I've brought you here.
|06_00035
|-
|Through there, Alyx Vance.
|06_00036
|-
|You must go!
|06_00037
|-
|Your mission begins, Alyx Vance.
|06_00038
|-
|Go!
|06_00039
|-
|The Eli Vance! The Alyx Vance! I am here to help as I said I would. Go! I will ensure your father's safety.

|-
|[Grunting]
|06_00042
|-
|I will lead the Eli Vance to safety.
|06_00043
|-
|Then you will.
|06_00045
|-
|Courage, Alyx Vance!
|06_00046
|-
|We have been in trapped in the dark.
|06_00063
|-
|The Alyx Vance you are our friend.
|06_00064
|-
|The Combine drain from us the power they use to protect their weapon.
|06_00065
|-
|We are ripped from ourselves.
|06_00066
|-
|No the Vortigaunt will extract ourselves and exact our own vengeance. YOU must go to the weapon.
|06_00067
|-
|Do not worry, Alyx Vance. They will not be. We will not allow it.
|06_00068
|-
|Now, go! We each have our paths. We cannot fail.
|06_00072

|The Alyx Vance must come.
|06_00104
|-
|Please, come.
|06_00105
|-
|I will clear the path.
|06_00106
|-
|Go. Our paths diverge. But remember: There is no distance between us. We are coterminous.
|06_00107
|-
|I am diminished. The Vortessence is distant from me I hear its song, but faintly.
|06_00109
