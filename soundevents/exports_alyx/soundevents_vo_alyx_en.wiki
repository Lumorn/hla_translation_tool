|Terrific.
|01_01104
|-
|Go! We'll be in touch.
|01_01106
|-
|What is it?
|01_01107
|-
|One hundred percent.
|01_01108
|-
|Keep your head down and be smart.
|01_01109
|-
|What the hell was that?
|01_01135
|-
|Jeff?
|01_01139
|-
|Who?
|01_01140
|-
|Jeff.

|-
|[Coughing] Damn!
|01_01145
|-
|[Coughing] Ugh
|01_01146
|-
|Russell?
|01_01150
|-
|I've been in an accident.
|01_01151
|-
|Wait. Wait. Where's Dad?
|01_01152
|-
|Okay, got it.
|01_01153
|-
|So Dad's okay, right?
|01_01154
|-
|But
|01_01155
|-
|And you saved me?
|01_01156
|-
|Do we know where they're taking him?
|01_01157
|-
|Ready.
|01_01161
|-
|Hm. Didn't work.
|01_01162
|-
|Still not working.
|01_01163
|-
|Uh uh.
|01_01164
|-
|Nope.
|01_01165
|-
|How's that?
|01_01166
|-
|Thanks, Russell.
|01_01171
|-
|I know.
|01_01172
|-
|Oh!
|01_01173
|-
|I did?
|01_01174
|-
|So, what's a Vortigaunt doing here?
|01_01176
|-
|Right, but I mean in general.
|01_01177
|-
|Oh. I'm sorry to
|01_01178
|-
|Eli Vance
|01_01180
|-
|The Combine have him, and I really do need to get moving.
|01_01181
|-
|Look, I appreciate
|01_01182
|-
|I can't stick around, I
|01_01183
|-
|I'm sure it is, but
|01_01184
|-
|Okay.
|01_01185
|-
|I would help. I really would. But the Alyx Vance is honestly very busy saving her Dad.
|01_01186
|-
|What?
|01_01187
|-
|Is? Or will be?
|01_01188
|-
|I'm sorry.
|01_01190
|-
|I haven't.
|01_01192
|-
|Why?
|01_01193
|-
|Okay. Thanks. Are you done? Helping?
|01_01194
|-
|Uh I'll eat it later. Thanks for the help.
|01_01195
|-
|Uh, sure. Yeah. I'll be there in a minute.
|01_11107
|-
|Nope. It exploded. I'm fine, by the way.
|01_11108
|-
|Russell. They've got Dad.
|01_11110
|-
|Oh God
|01_11111
|-
|Which is?
|01_11112
|-
|Great. Let's hear it.
|01_11113
|-
|Russell.
|01_11114
|-
|Stop.
|01_11115
|-
|And if he gets on that train that's it, right?
|01_11116
|-
|I thought you said \
|01_11117
|-
|Okay.
|01_11119
|-
|Got it.
|01_11122
|-
|I'm already headed out on foot.
|01_11126
|-
|Then I'm headed on foot.
|01_11127
|-
|Thanks, Russell.
|01_11131
|-
|Tell you what, Russell. If I die, I owe you a gun.
|01_11132
|-
|I got a dead zombie here. I-I thought the Combine sealed up the QZ?
|01_11133
|-
|Probably not a one-off, then.
|01_11134
|-
|Oof, they're gross.
|01_11135
|-
|Hey, Russell. I just found a loose syringe of God knows what. Is this medicine?
|01_11140
|-
|I don't see one.
|01_11141
|-
|I feel GREAT.
|01_11142
|-
|I take it the Quarantine Zone is behind this hatch?
|01_11143
|-
|I'll look around for a control panel to open it up.
|01_11144
|-
|I'm gonna head in. How far is Fairview Junction?
|01_11145
|-
|Have they started moving Dad yet?
|01_11146
|-
|Oh, that's great.
|01_11147
|-
|Mm-hmm.
|01_11148
|-
|So when did you start calling the gravity gloves the \
|01_11155
|-
|How'd you meet my Dad, anyway? You guys worked together at Black Mesa, right?
|01_11164
|-
|Russell. Russell  I didn't eat it.
|01_11167
|-
|Um, nope. Not once.
|01_11188
|-
|You guys had all that? That's insane.
|01_11189
|-
|Wow!
|01_11190
|-
|Yeah, you sure do.
|01_11191
|-
|That is Wow.
|01_11194
|-
|What'd you?
|01_01197
|-
|Okay
|01_01198
|-
|Thanks.
|01_01199
|-
|Whoa whoa whoa whoa, waitwaitwait! I just I just live here!
|01_01200
|-
|Hey! Wait wait no no no n
|01_01201
|-
|Russell what did you guys find back there?
|01_01205
|-
|The Citadel?
|01_01206
|-
|Russell? Just hang on, I'm almost there.
|01_01207
|-
|Oof. I think that's the last of them.
|01_11309
|-
|Got it!
|01_11310
|-
|Is it supposed to come off?!
|01_11313
|-
|W-w-what do I do  What do I do now?!
|01_11314
|-
|I'm not panicking!
|01_11315
|-
|It won't stay!
|01_11322
|-
|Got it!
|01_11323
|-
|Holy crap!
|01_11325
|-
|Train train train train TRAIN!
|01_11326
|-
|I'm okay. Let's go find Dad.
|01_11327
|-
|How do you know all of this?
|01_11336
|-
|Hey, how do I disconnect the cables?
|01_11337
|-
|Yep.
|01_11338
|-
|I'm going to open it up and deactivate it.
|01_11339
|-
|You're free now. It's okay, your friend sent me.
|01_11340
|-
|What are they doing to you here?
|01_11341
|-
|We have to stop them from killing your friends.
|01_11344
|-
|I can't get into the Vault if the substations are still online.
|01_11345
|-
|Oh my God. Where's Dad?
|01_11600
|-
|Dad? DAD?
|01_11601
|-
|Dad!
|01_11602
|-
|I'm coming!
|01_11603
|-
|I'll be right there! One sec!
|01_11605
|-
|Okay. I'm going to reach out and pull you up. It's gonna be okay. You ready?
|01_11607
|-
|Give me your hand!
|01_11608
|-
|DAD!
|01_11609
|-
|[Shocked Gasp]
|01_11610
|-
|Thank you, oh my God, thank you! Dad, stay there! I'm gonna figure out how to get down to you!
|01_11611
|-
|A superweapon?
|01_11612
|-
|Then we've gotta steal it before they do!
|01_11613
|-
|So what's the plan?
|01_11614
|-
|Dad! Where's the vault?
|01_11615
|-
|I yes. Look to the star. Got it. Dad?
|01_11616
|-
|Great! Thank you.
|01_11617
|-
|I love you too!
|01_11618
|-
|Wait w-wait wait! Don't shoot!
|01_11300
|-
|DAD!
|01_11301
|-
|Whoa.
|01_11305
|-
|Yeah, what happened?
|01_11306
|-
|Which means?
|01_11382
|-
|Gotta go.
|01_11400
|-
|Let's talk later.
|01_11401
|-
|Hold on, I gotta go.
|01_11402
|-
|Russell, I gotta go.
|01_11403
|-
|Later, gotta go.
|01_11404
|-
|Hold on, I'm busy.
|01_11405
|-
|Hold on, I got company.
|01_11406
|-
|Crap, Combine.
|01_11407
|-
|It's good, Dad. Metro Cop movement is normal. Same for the Combine patrols. How's it going in the stockyard?
|01_11409
|-
|I see it!
|01_11413
|-
|Ahh!
|01_11415
|-
|What is that?
|01_11416
|-
|Oh boy.
|01_11417
|-
|No shortcut?
|01_11418
|-
|Well let's take the long way.
|01_11419
|-
|Oh, man.
|01_11420
|-
|Thanks. You know, for all your talk about what a \
|01_11421
|-
|Russell, are you seeing this?
|01_11423
|-
|It looks like it's just cardboard.
|01_11424
|-
|Yeah. Weird, though.
|01_11425
|-
|I'm fine, Russell, what's up?
|01_11426
|-
|Russell? Russell! Crap.
|01_11427
|-
|I  Look. Thank you for everything. But I really have to go. And I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for riddles.
|01_11428
|-
|Look, if I can, if I run across your friends, I will see what I can do.
|01_11429
|-
|Yeah. IF.
|01_11434
|-
|Wow. Russ.
|01_11435
|-
|Well, you asked.
|01_11447
|-
|Where where are we?
|01_11448
|-
|What? Unless WHAT?
|01_11449
|-
|You know, Russell; Now that I'm walking into the Quarantine Zone It just hit me. I don't know any thing about the Quarantine Zone.
|01_11456
|-
|Alllright. Cool.
|01_11457
|-
|You downloaded the entire Internet.
|01_11458
|-
|Nice.
|01_11459
|-
|NOW it's gonna get weird?
|01_11462
|-
|Okay, I'm bracing myself.
|01_11465
|-
|I think I think I killed all the aliens. I think they're all dead now.
|01_11467
|-
|Now we just gotta get to the vault, get the weapon, kick the Combine off Earth  super easy  and they're  and there's sandwiches, there's gonna be sandwiches
|01_11468
|-
|Good. I hope they're good.
|01_11469
|-
|Okay, so: Right now, what it's like to live on Earth, on a scale of one to ten  I'd say we're at a two.
|01_11474
|-
|What would you rate it BEFORE the Combine showed up?
|01_11475
|-
|Six? That's not great.
|01_11476
|-
|Well, maybe we get the Combine off Earth and we could shoot for like an eight, you know?
|01_11477
|-
|So when we get the Combine off of earth, what are you going to do?
|01_11478
|-
|Oh, of course! You'll be sitting on a landmine!
|01_11479
|-
|So this whole three year Russell plan you think, uh you think you'd have a job for me?
|01_11480
|-
|We could be partners.
|01_11481
|-
|I don't know what any of that meant, but it sounds good, partner.
|01_11482
|-
|Umm uh, well, Dad and I would get a house and help rebuild, you know? And then I'd, you know probably start a secret lab.
|01_11483
|-
|Well, yeah. So I'd start my lab and I wouldn't even need locks, or doors, or windows that close!
|01_11484
|-
|Ohhh. Pfft, right.
|01_11485
|-
|Gotta go.
|01_11619
|-
|Alyx! Alyx Vance!
|01_12202
|-
|Yep! I trapped Jeff in a trash compactor.
|01_12203
|-
|And then I crushed him.
|01_12204
|-
|Alyx! Alyx Vance!
|01_12206
|-
|Whoa!
|01_12005
|-
|AH!
|01_12006
|-
|HOLY!
|01_12007
|-
|GAH!
|01_12008
|-
|J-J-OH GOD
|01_12009
|-
|Alright, fair enough.
|01_12011
|-
|Got it. Will it work on the Russells?
|01_12012
|-
|Ngh! It's on my face! On my face!
|01_12020
|-
|Oh my God, OH MY GOD ON MY OH GOD NO
|01_12021
|-
|Agh! Get off! Get off!
|01_12022
|-
|[Straining, Gasping for Breath]
|01_12023
|-
|Any news on Dad?
|01_12040
|-
|Heard anything about Dad, Russell?
|01_12041
|-
|Damnit.
|01_12042
|-
|How is that good news?
|01_12043
|-
|I'll take it.
|01_12044
|-
|How do you know that?
|01_12045
|-
|Russell! I'm good! How's Dad?
|01_12046
|-
|I'm working on it.
|01_12047
|-
|You're not gonna believe this, but I ran into a Vortigaunt.
|01_12048
|-
|Hiding. I think he escaped from the Combine.
|01_12049
|-
|You ever meet a Vortigaunt? He said crazy Vortigaunt stuff.
|01_12050
|-
|Oh, that Vortigaunt I met? He did give me a headcrab to eat.
|01_12051
|-
|The Combine off Earth. I want the Combine off Earth.
|01_12052
|-
|I don't know. But we need to find Dad.
|01_12055
|-
|You know  it got a bit messy back there, but we did get Dad back.
|01_12056
|-
|What?
|01_12057
|-
|Holy crap. That's gotta be the Vault.
|01_12058
|-
|So even if we MAKE it there, we still have to get UP to it.
|01_12059
|-
|And break whatever's at the other end.
|01_12060
|-
|Will I have to look out any windows to bring the Vault down?
|01_12061
|-
|Then I'm all for it.
|01_12062
|-
|No, no  the Vortigaunt said \
|01_12067
|-
|Like the power and security you'd need for a giant vault.
|01_12068
|-
|And there's the vault.
|01_12069
|-
|I can't figure out how to get into this thing.
|01_12070
|-
|Russell? You're breaking up again.
|01_12071
|-
|I'll use a little bit of technology I like to call \
|01_12072
|-
|Nevermind, I won't be using the stairs.
|01_12073
|-
|Getting kinda crowded down here, Russ.
|01_12080
|-
|Well, now I just want it more.
|01_12081
|-
|I I trust him.
|01_12082
|-
|Russ. Trusting him is our only plan here. He'll do this. We can do this.
|01_12083
|-
|Well, it's huge so it shouldn't be hard to know which way I'm going.
|01_12084
|-
|I don't understand what they're doing with it, here.
|01_12085
|-
|If this weapon is so powerful, why keep it locked up in a dump like this?
|01_12086
|-
|Why not use it HERE?
|01_12087
|-
|Are you SEEING that?!
|01_12088
|-
|What is it?
|01_12089
|-
|Yes!
|01_12090
|-
|It better.
|01_12091
|-
|Okay. So, what do you think?
|01_12092
|-
|Okay, I don't see a way into this building, so I'm going to look around.
|01_12093
|-
|What is this place, anyway?
|01_12094
|-
|Is vodka good?
|01_12095
|-
|Russell doesn't like vodka, got it.
|01_12096
|-
|But it's not good?
|01_12097
|-
|But
|01_12098
|-
|Okay, that's all very confusing.
|01_12099
|-
|There's definitely a bunch of old bottles in here. Does alcohol go bad?
|01_12100
|-
|Russell? You're breaking up.
|01_12101
|-
|Well, oh well.
|01_12102
|-
|Hey, Russ. Vortigaunts just took down another one.
|01_12103
|-
|Russ! The Vorts are taking down another substation!
|01_12104
|-
|Russ? Ugh.
|01_12105
|-
|More or less  you're breaking up.
|01_12107
|-
|I made a friend named Jeff.
|01_12108
|-
|Yeah, we're not really close.
|01_12109
|-
|The Combine sealed up the exit in here. I'm getting it back open and getting outta here.
|01_12110
|-
|I-I can't hear you. Russell!
|01_12111
|-
|Great. Also, little heads up, I think the tunnel is full of antlions, just in case I cut out permanently.
|01_12113
|-
|Yeah, you know. Aliens with stabby legs.
|01_12114
|-
|No.
|01_12115
|-
|No, that's not them. These ones are pretty dangerous.
|01_12116
|-
|Yep. Off I go.
|01_12117
|-
|WHAT?!
|01_12123
|-
|That's an antlion, Russell.
|01_12124
|-
|Yes. So you DO know what antlions are.
|01_12125
|-
|That's the last substation! He did it!
|01_12126
|-
|Guys. Can we figure this out later? That cable stirred up an antlion nest.
|01_12128
|-
|I don't know. But something's keeping it up there. And we're running out of time to find it.
|01_12129
|-
|Great! What is it, Dad?
|01_12130
|-
|Okay, got it.
|01_12131
|-
|There's cables coming out of it. I think they connect to a power source. I'll get over there and disconnect them. Well. Shoot them.
|01_12132
|-
|Right. What IS inside, anyway?
|01_12134
|-
|Oh man, Russ, don't jinx me.
|01_12135
|-
|Oh crap. Moving. Moving.
|01_12136
|-
|Textbook! Textbook jinxing, Russell!
|01_12137
|-
|Agh! Moving. Still moving.
|01_12138
|-
|Gahhh!
|01_12139
|-
|Ahhh
|01_12140
|-
|Russell! Big gun up ahead.
|01_12143
|-
|Yeah, I just had it too.
|01_12144
|-
|I just had it too. And it's a good one.
|01_12145
|-
|I'm shooting it!
|01_12146
|-
|Russell, lemme shoot!
|01_12147
|-
|No. Probably not.
|01_12149
|-
|Yeah.
|01_12150
|-
|Everything'll be fine, Russ. Talk to you soon.
|01_12151
|-
|Russell? I'm out.
|01_12156
|-
|Hey, Russell? I, uh I'm out again.
|01_12157
|-
|Russell? I'm out. Again.
|01_12158
|-
|Oh! Also  I spotted the Combine moving supplies into the Quarantine Zone. That place has been deserted for years.
|01_12600
|-
|Ahh. Okay.
|01_12604
|-
|Right.
|01_12605
|-
|Russ, I promise, your gloves are safe with me.
|01_12606
|-
|So is vodka any good?
|01_12607
|-
|Let me figure out how to get in, and then I'll find you some.
|01_12608
|-
|There's no straight shot to the Vault. I'm gonna head inside and find a way around this barricade.
|01_12609
|-
|There's no straight shot to the Vault. I'm gonna head inside and find a way out.
|01_12610
|-
|Got it, thanks.
|01_12612
|-
|[Coughs] Got it, thanks.
|01_12613
|-
|Got it, thanks.
|01_12614
|-
|Hooooly crap!
|01_12615
|-
|Have you heard any Combine chatter about Dad escaping?
|01_12616
|-
|On the plus side, that means Dad is still on his way back to you. We'd have heard if they'd recaptured Eli Vance.
|01_12617
|-
|Getting to the Vault isn't going to get any easier.
|01_12618
|-
|So I AM eventually gonna run out of ammo.
|01_12646
|-
|Ahh!
|01_12650
|-
|Ah!
|01_12651
|-
|Ahh!
|01_12652
|-
|Right. So he's okay, right? He lives. My Dad lives.
|01_12654
|-
|No! I-I-I just want to go home. Send me home!
|01_12656
|-
|Yep  they got the reactor, easy peasy.
|01_12658
|-
|I'm headed back to the safehouse right now to meet Dad.
|01_12660
|-
|Don't get greedy, guys. We're not made of time here.
|01_12700
|-
|Sounds good. Where's the train I'm taking?
|01_12702
|-
|Yeah, we are.
|01_12703
|-
|The brand name?
|01_12704
|-
|That's THE Vort!
|01_12706
|-
|Nah, I'm still looking.
|01_12709
|-
|Here we go.
|01_12710
|-
|Boom. Power back on.
|01_12711
|-
|Now just have to get the elevator some juice.
|01_12712
|-
|And up we
|01_12713
|-
|Hmm.
|01_12714
|-
|This place is overgrown. How dangerous do we think this stuff really is?
|01_12715
|-
|I'm really starting to think I shouldn't be breathing this stuff.
|01_12716
|-
|Kinda slimy? A little tingly.
|01_12717
|-
|Ow.
|01_12718
|-
|Sharp.
|01_12719
|-
|Like a six.
|01_12720
|-
|A strong six.
|01_12721
|-
|Yep. Of course.
|01_12722
|-
|Uh oh, this guy's not wearing a shirt.
|01_12723
|-
|Gotcha.
|01_12724
|-
|Thannnk you.
|01_12725
|-
|Oh, that's not good.
|01_12726
|-
|There was like a dog-looking lightning thing.
|01_12727
|-
|I killed it and it crapped out this thing?
|01_12728
|-
|Hey, Russell. This thing fell out of the dog.
|01_12729
|-
|Ah crap, lightning dog.
|01_12730
|-
|Oh my God, it went into a guy! Russell?
|01_12731
|-
|New development: It went into a dead guy.
|01_12732
|-
|Yes. I had to shoot both of them, it was NUTS, Russell.
|01_12733
|-
|Oh, it was.
|01_12734
|-
|Uh oh.
|01_12735
|-
|Yeah, oof. This one was kinda rough.
|01_12736
|-
|Yeah Russ, I'm good.
|01_12737
|-
|I'm working on it.
|01_12738
|-
|Found an elevator up.
|01_12739
|-
|Alright, we're getting close to the substation here.
|01_12746
|-
|I'll figure out how to shut it down.
|01_12747
|-
|Alright  this should turn off that wall.
|01_12748
|-
|Oh man.
|01_12749

|01_12766
|-
|It's too dark. I need a flashlight.
|01_12767
|-
|I'll need a flashlight if I want to go in there.
|01_12768
|-
|I'd never survive a jump from this height.
|01_12769
|-
|Nope.
|01_12770
|-
|I don't think so.
|01_12771
|-
|Nope. That'll kill me.
|01_12774
|-
|Ohh. Thank God.
|01_12779
|-
|I'm on it.
|01_20100
|-
|I can see that, Russell.
|01_20101
|-
|Yep, doing great, no worries no worries no worries
|01_20102
|-
|I saw a lever outside!
|01_20104
|-
|It switches the tracks!
|01_20105
|-
|to a wall.
|01_20106
|-
|I don't know!
|01_20108
|-
|There's gotta be another way to stop this train
|01_20109
|-
|You sure you can do that?
|01_20111
|-
|Nice.
|01_20112
|-
|Ahh!
|01_20113
|-
|That's the switch!
|01_20114
|-
|Russell! Check out this lever!
|01_20115
|-
|I'll be ready.
|01_20127
|-
|Yes, WHEN.
|01_20129
|-
|Oh, Dad said he stole some files about this weapon.
|01_20135
|-
|You're my guy?
|01_20136
|-
|Oh.
|01_20137
|-
|But not data encryption.
|01_20138
|-
|Oh my God, Jeff. Are you okay? [Laughs]
|01_20140
|-
|Oh Okay, will do.
|01_20141
|-
|Ah, they're locking down the area.
|01_20142
|-
|Yeah, good luck.
|01_20143
|-
|Whoa! Russell! Vorts just took down the last substation!
|01_20149
|-
|Wait, what the
|01_20150
|-
|I heard him.
|01_20151
|-
|I hope whoever is in there is worth it.
|01_20152
|-
|Maybe we'd have lasted eight.
|01_20164
|-
|I'm on my way.
|01_20166
|-
|Phew, thanks.
|01_20169
|-
|Oh. Yeah, definitely. You're gonna want to put that in Year Two.

|Russell, you've been watching everything that's happened today.
|01_20271
|-
|Dad, I'm gonna go find this vault!
|01_20272
|-
|Ewww.
|01_20274
|-
|Yeuch.
|01_20276
|-
|Ew.
|01_20278
|-
|Yeuch.
|01_20280
|-
|You see that? Russell? Russell!
|01_20281
|-
|Gordon Freeman?
|01_13133
|-
|So who are you?
|01_13135
|-
|Alright, it looks like the bridge is fully extended
|01_05500
|-
|Okay, well, one of these has to bring in the vault for docking, right? Right?
|01_055003
|-
|Um. That's not it.
|01_055004
|-
|Oooh, kay, definitely not.
|01_055005
|-
|Maybe?!
|01_055006
|-
|That doesn't look good Ugh!
|01_055007
|-
|Just need to GENTLY dock the vault TO the bridge.
|01_05501
|-
|How hard can that be?
|01_05502
|-
|Keep what in?
|01_05508
|-
|Huh, I think I can reroute this with my multi-tool.
|01_13000
|-
|It's a tool with multiple functions. So, you know  multi-tool.
|01_13001
|-
|Who am I gonna sell it to?
|01_13002
|-
|Well, how about I call it the \
|01_13003
|-
|Yeah, the \
|01_13004
|-
|Whoa! Here we go.
|01_13005
|-
|Hey, Russ. Keep an eye out for Dad, okay?
|01_13006
|-
|Aaaand the power's out.
|01_13007
|-
|Looks like we're taking the stairs.
|01_13008
|-
|Aaaand the stairs are out.
|01_13009
|-
|Ooo, breaker boxes.
|01_13010
|-
|Let's go back to the elevator plan. I'm gonna get the power back on.
|01_13012
|-
|Here we go  breaker boxes.
|01_13013
|-
|Power's back on. Let's check the elevator.
|01_13014
|-
|Argh! Rat's nest.
|01_13015
|-
|Elevator's still not on yet.
|01_13016
|-
|Y'know, this all looks good.
|01_13017
|-
|Maybe we missed something out by the elevator.
|01_13018
|-
|Looks like we're taking the ladder.
|01_13019
|-
|THAT'S Jeff.
|01_13020
|-
|THAT'S Jeff  keep your voice down!
|01_13021
|-
|He's an acquired taste.
|01_13022
|-
|Ya know Russ, I'm sorry I didn't get you any vodka back there.
|01_13023
|-
|You know, I hope you appreciate how much of a pain in the butt it is carrying this vodka around.
|01_13024
|-
|Wait Dad What?!
|01_13025
|-
|Whoa, okay. So if it's not a weapon, are we still doing this?
|01_13026
|-
|True
|01_13027
|-
|We've come this far, I say we keep going. And if you find out it's something we really shouldn't mess with, we'll call it off.
|01_13028
|-
|So, head towards those beams, right?
|01_13029
|-
|Nothing, I'm on my way.
|01_13030
|-
|Alright, here we go.
|01_13032
|-
|Whoa, Russell, are you seeing this?
|01_13033
|-
|Alright, Russ. REALLY need you to talk again.
|01_13035
|-
|It's really dark Russ?
|01_13037
|-
|Can you just talk?
|01_13038
|-
|About anything, literally anything.
|01_13039
|-
|Okay, that was my fault. I'll be more specific next time.
|01_13040
|-
|There's somebody up there!
|01_13041
|-
|Whoa whoa! Shh!
|01_13042
|-
|Wait SHH!
|01_13043
|-
|Shh! Sh-sh-shh Quiet!
|01_13044
|-
|Oh, wow. That's good, right?
|01_13045
|-
|Alright. So let's go save Gordon Freeman.
|01_13046
|-
|Oh. Incoming. Hey, gimme a second.
|01_13047
|-
|Okay, so the plan is to get to that control room and get Gordon. You know, I'll be honest, people talk about him a lot, but I always just assumed he was dead.
|01_13048
|-
|Hey, Dad. Are you there?
|01_13049
|-
|If Gordon survived Black Mesa where's he been?
|01_13050
|-
|Once we get Gordon back, we can really get ambitious, don't you think, Russ? Maybe we could take down the Citadel.
|01_13051
|-
|And this time he won't have to do it alone.
|01_13052
|-
|Yeah, Dad.
|01_13053
|-
|What's the security like inside?
|01_13054
|-
|I guess I'll have to improvise.
|01_13055
|-
|There's the control room.
|01_13056
|-
|Alright, here we go. Time to go rescue the savior of humanity.
|01_13057
|-
|Oh God.
|01_1305862
|-
|Damn it.
|01_13059
|-
|Now what?
|01_13060
|-
|Oh! Terrific.
|01_13061
|-
|Okay, okay, well, one of these has gotta extend the bridge right?
|01_13063
|-
|Uhhh
|01_13064
|-
|THIS one.
|01_13065
|-
|I know, Russ, I can see it not moving.
|01_13066
|-
|Oh God. Oh God Oh GOD!
|01_13067
|-
|Ahhh!
|01_13068
|-
|Russ! Russell! Put Dad on!
|01_13069
|-
|Dad! We just took down a substation!
|01_13070
|-
|We will. You've still got that datapod, right?
|01_13071
|-
|For sure. You go ahead, I'll be fine, Dad  I promise.
|01_13072
|-
|Holy crap, they must've been terrified of this thing.
|01_13073
|-
|Nope. Still looking.
|01_13086
|-
|Russel the Combine use these. Are they safe for people?
|01_13087
|-
|Are you sure?
|01_13088
|-
|Ow! Ow-ow-ow. [Sucking in Air]
|01_13089
|-
|Ahhhhh. Hey
|01_13090
|-
|Hey you were right. These are great.
|01_13091
|-
|Ahhh. Ooh.
|01_13092
|-
|Ahhh. Nice.
|01_13093
|-
|See it!
|01_13094
|-
|Thanks. Thanks Russell.
|01_13096
|-
|Yeah When you guys were off stealing the reactor, I saw the Combine moving supplies in here. So, I guess they're interested in this place again.
|01_13097
|-
|What IS that?
|01_13098
|-
|It looks like pictures of Vortigaunts
|01_13099
|-
|Somebody spent a lot of time on this.
|01_13100
|-
|Whoa! More floating cardboard.
|01_13101
|-
|That's weird.
|01_13102
|-
|Just stay there! I'm gonna figure out how to get over to you!
|01_13103
|-
|Ooo, grenades.
|01_13104
|-
|Ugh. Total waste of a grenade.
|01_13105
|-
|Agreed.

|Yes!
|01_13114
|-
|Whoa!
|01_13115
|-
|What do you think, Russ? Guess we'd better cooperate.
|01_13116
|-

|01_50600
|-
|You know, Russ  technically? I don't think there's a whole lot of your gun left anymore.
|01_50601
|-
|Well, Russ, it's official. There is NOTHING left of your gun in this gun. This is just this is MY gun.
|01_50602

|01_70032
|-
|[Sniffs] Ugh. This stuff reeks.
|01_70035

|Like a rotting animal mixed with ammonia.
|01_70036
|-
|What if it GIVES me cancer?
|01_70043
|-
|Russ, I'm gonna do less touching.
|01_70044
|-
|Russell! These guys have automatic weapons!
|01_70060
|-
|These guys have automatic weapons.
|01_70061
|-
|I'll keep my fingers crossed on the, uh option one. Just gonna roll with the genes I'm currently working with.
|01_70063
|-
|That's a lot of words while a lot of bullets are flying at me, Russ!
|01_70064

|01_70501
|-
|I'm I'm good, Russ. I'm just going to roll with these genes that I've got.
|01_70503
|-
|The more I touch this stuff, the more I think it's probably toxic.
|01_70504
|-
|There it is. That elevator will take me up to the substation.
|01_70505
|-
|Not to be a worrier, but shouldn't Dad be back by now?
|01_70506
|-
|Yeah. So I should be worried.
