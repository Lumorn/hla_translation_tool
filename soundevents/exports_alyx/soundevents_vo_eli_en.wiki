|Alyx! How's it looking up there?
|02_01103
|-
|[Laughs] One Combine mini-reactor from a shipment of 4000. They're never gonna miss it. Here, see for yourself.
|02_01104
|-
|Hmm. That IS odd. Well, we'll look into it when we get back.
|02_01105
|-
|Meet back at the safehouse, baby. We'll be there soon. What is it, Russell?

|-
|Russell? Where is he? Is he alright?
|02_01114
|-
|We don't have time. It's a weapon, Alyx! It's what they're hiding in here. It-It's what we found out about and that's why they grabbed us.
|02_01118
|-
|They got it in a vault a tower, with security all around it.
|02_01119
|-
|There's a substation nearby.
|02_01120
|-
|See? I'll be fine. Now get moving.
|02_01130
|-
|Alyx, whatever this weapon is, you need to either steal it or destroy it.
|02_01132
|-
|[Chuckling] I love you, baby.
|02_01136
|-
|I love you, baby!
|02_01216
|-
|What is it, Russell?
|02_01223
|-
|We didn't steal anything!
|02_01300
|-
|No one! I didn't see anyone!
|02_01301
|-
|Baby!
|02_01500
|-
|I'm over here, honey! I need help, hurry!
|02_01502
|-
|Baby! Over here!
|02_01503
|-
|Help me up help me up
|02_01504
|-
|Hurry, baby! Hurry! I'm losing my grip.

|-
|Ungh!
|02_01508
|-
|Almost Almost Gah!
|02_01509
|-
|No! Alyx, listen! The thing Russell and I found is some sort of some sort of superweapon!
|02_01510
|-
|It's something big. They've got it here in the QZ in some kind of vault. But they're about to move it. Where, I don't know, but it's going to be soon.
|02_01511
|-
|Yes! And look, look I managed to pocket this Combine datapod. If I can decrypt it, we can figure out how to use their weapon against them.
|02_01512
|-
|You head to the Vault. I'll take this thing back to Russell's and get to work.
|02_01513
|-
|It's right in the middle of the QZ, and it's big. Get above ground and see what you can find.
|02_01514
|-
|Go!
|02_01515
|-
|Yeah I'm good.
|02_01517
|-
|Gordon! Gordon! Wake up, Gordon!
|02_01600
|-
|She's gone, Gordon. She's GONE.

|[Exhaling Deeply]
|02_01603
|-
|Come on, Gordon.
|02_01604
|-
|We've got work to do.
|02_01605
|-
|Agh!
|02_01350
|-
|I don't know, but
|02_01606
|-
|You keep heading for the Vault. I'll poke around the datapod. See if I can figure something out.
|02_01607
|-
|Alyx! I found something!
|02_01608
|-
|There's a Gravity Field Generator directly under the Vault. That's GOT to be what's keeping it up.
|02_01609
|-
|Russell, stop her!
|02_01610
|-
|Alyx! Don't go in the V  [Signal Cuts Out]
|02_01611
|-
|Right there. That's the Gravity Field Generator.
|02_01614
|-
|Russell! Goddamn, it's good to see you!
|02_01615
|-
|Alyx! Baby!
|02_01616
|-
|There it goes
|02_01619
|-
|I'm working on it. Alyx, find a way in there. Go!
|02_01621
|-
|[Groaning in Pain]
|02_01702
|-
|Stay safe, baby. I love you.
|02_01704
|-
|Thank you Thank you Oh God

|-
|Prison
|02_02000
|-
|It's not a vault. It's a prison. They didn't build it to keep us OUT. They're trying to keep something IN.
|02_02001
|-
|The way I see it, whatever's in there doesn't like the Combine very much. So we've got THAT in common.
|02_02002
|-
|So Are we still doing this?
|02_02003
|-
|That's my girl. I'll let you know what I find out.
|02_02004
|-
|Tell Alyx there's no way that backup is stable. She can shut it down.
|02_02005
|-
|Goddamn it, Russ, they've got Gordon Freeman.
|02_02006
|-
|This is very, VERY good.
|02_02007
|-
|Damn right. We're gonna get Gordon Freeman back.
|02_02008
|-
|Yeah, what's up, Alyx?
|02_02009
|-
|I don't know. But I bet it's a hell of a story.
|02_02010
|-
|Alyx You there?
|02_02011
|-
|It looks like you WILL be able to get into the Vault from up there. There's a terminal that extends a bridge to the entrance.
|02_02012
|-
|I've got it all laid out in front of me and I'll tell you There IS security, but I've never seen anything like it. It doesn't make any sense.
|02_02013
|-
|Eh, don't worry, honey. I'll figure it out.
|02_02014
|-
|You know, honey, you haven't been doing too bad yourself.
|02_02015
|-
|Earth could've used you in the Seven Hour War.
|02_02016
|-
|Alyx? Alyx! Alyx, are you okay?
|02_02017
|-
|I don't know. I'm not sure if this datapod even knows. But they got something trapped in there.
|02_02018
|-
|I do. Russ, this thing's biocoded. I'm gonna need the TLI.
|02_02019
|-
|Okay, great. You good, honey?
|02_02020
|-
|Keep that promise. I'll get to work on the datapod.
|02_02021
|-
|I've got something.
|02_02022
|-
|I don't know what the weapon is yet. But I DO know how they got it.
|02_02023
|-
|It doesn't look like they actually built the weapon. It's like they I don't know, discovered something. Or maybe they uncovered it.
|02_02024
|-
|If I'm reading this right, they tracked it to an old apartment building in the QZ. But instead of going in to get it, they grabbed the whole building and built a vault around it.
|02_02025
|-
|I'm trying to figure out whether WE oughta be.
|02_02026
|-
|You can thank that Vortigaunt. He got me back here in one piece.
|02_02030
|-
|What is it, Russell?
|02_03001
|-
|Russell, let her think!
|02_03002
|-
|Good. Because when they move this thing, that weapon's gone. We need to get it tonight.
