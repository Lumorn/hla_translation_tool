|What is?
|05_00003
|-
|It looks like
|05_00004
|-
|Put on the headset!
|05_00005
|-
|Alyx! Put on the headset!
|05_00006
|-
|Alyx! Put  Alyx! P-Put on the headset!
|05_00007
|-
|Alyx! If you're still alive, put on the headset.
|05_00008
|-
|I can see you in there! There's no reason you shouldn't be putting on the headset! Alyx!
|05_00009
|-
|It's not a trick! It's Russell, alright? Your dad's friend from work! The Resistance!
|05_00010
|-
|It's not a trick, Alyx!
|05_00011
|-
|Alyx! You there? You-You've got to get moving.
|05_00012
|-
|I know! I caused it! So technically not an accident. You've got to get moving.
|05_00013
|-
|You've got to get moving!
|05_00014
|-
|Get moving, Alyx.
|05_00015
|-
|Alyx, you need to get out of here. Now.
|05_00016
|-
|He's fine. Follow the drone.
|05_00017
|-
|Yeah. Well, no. To be honest, he's in huge trouble.
|05_00019
|-
|They've still got him. He was in a separate transport.
|05_00020
|-
|Well, yes. I had no way of knowing who was in which van. So Yes. The result was that I saved YOU.
|05_00021
|-
|Criminal holding. And then, when they realize he's Eli Vance to Nova Prospekt.
|05_00022
|-
|But I'm already working on a plan to get him back.
|05_00023
|-
|You're close to my lab. Keep following the drone! We'll figure out what to do.
|05_00024
|-
|Alyx, everything cut out for a second! I lost the headset video feed. Can you see my drone? Is it okay?
|05_00027
|-
|Alyx, great. Okay, let's  wait. My drone's okay, right?
|05_00031
|-
|Now. Pretty soon they're gonna realize that your dad is not gonna talk. And when THAT happens, he's off to have his brain sucked out.
|05_00036
|-
|Potentially. Maybe not, though. I mean, he could  they could just drill into his
|05_00037
|-
|Oh, yep. Still your dad. Right. Well, what they WILL do is take him by train from HERE
|05_00038
|-
|Not necessarily. Grab something that represents us.
|05_00039
|-
|Anything'll do.
|05_00040
|-
|Yeah, just grab anything.
|05_00041
|-
|I'll tell you what, I'll do it.
|05_00042
|-
|Okay, that's you.
|05_00043
|-
|Well, ONE of us  me  will have to stay here for this plan to work.
|05_00044
|-
|Just outside there's a second train that also leads out of City 17, through the Quarantine Zone.
|05_00045
|-
|Both trains intersect here, at Fairview Junction. You take your train, get there before his train, and hack into the controls. That'll let me take over the system.
|05_00046
|-
|Train comes to a halt. You deal with the Combine situation. And we get your dad back.
|05_00047
|-
|Out the back, through the yard. It's decommissioned, but I think I can hack into its controls.
|05_00048
|-
|Oh. And get yourself a pair of \
|05_00049
|-
|The gloves, Alyx. You know, the gravity gloves. I have a few sets through there. You can calibrate them out by the shed.
|05_00050
|-
|We can do this, Alyx. You got that, didn't you? That I said we could do it? 'Cause we're gonna do it.
|05_00051
|-
|I'm with you every step of the way.
|05_00052
|-
|Alright, you know how this goes. There should be a bunch of junk down there. Aim at something with your hand open.
|05_00053
|-
|Just point your hand at something.
|05_00054
|-
|These gloves aren't going to calibrate by themselves. But I suppose they probably should. That's one thing I haven't fixed on them.
|05_00055
|-
|Now close your hand and flick it towards you.
|05_00056
|-
|Just a little flick of the wrist.
|05_00057
|-
|Are you flicking? I can't tell if you're flicking.
|05_00058
|-
|Close and flick.
|05_00059
|-
|Okay, the reference sensor is way out of alignment.
|05_00060
|-
|Try again. Pick a target, aim at it, hand open.
|05_00061
|-
|Hmm.
|05_00062
|-
|Try again.
|05_00063
|-
|One more time.
|05_00064
|-
|Pick a target, aim at it, hand open.
|05_00065
|-
|Excellent! Now make a fist.
|05_00066
|-
|Alright, make a fist.
|05_00067
|-
|Registered. Now flick your wrist to bring it in.
|05_00068
|-
|Almost done. Do it again, only this time catch it.
|05_00069
|-
|Flick it again and try to catch it.
|05_00070
|-
|Perfect. We're done. Ooh! Oh, wait! I-I almost forgot.
|05_00071
|-
|Alyx! Up here!
|05_00072
|-
|You're gonna need a gun!
|05_00073
|-
|Pick up the gun, Alyx!
|05_00076
|-
|I doubt you'll need to use it much. There shouldn't be more than a few Combine transporting Eli.
|05_00077
|-
|And good luck, Alyx. Goodbye.
|05_00082
|-
|Obviously, just to let you know, I am still here, though.
|05_00084
|-
|That's the train, Alyx. See if you can hack the door open. I've almost got the train online here.
|05_00085
|-
|Is there any way to hack the train door?
|05_00086
|-
|See if you can get the door open.
|05_00087
|-
|Alright! Here we go. Next stop: Fairview Junction.
|05_00088
|-
|Good. I'll see if I can get you in some other way.
|05_00091
|-
|Ahh Would you look at that. Resin.
|05_00092
|-
|Well, you know in case it doesn't make it back.
|05_00099
|-
|Ah, this one must've squirted out. I heard they've had trouble with barnacle spores outside the containment area. But not about fellas like this.
|05_00101
|-
|I'd doubt it.
|05_00102
|-
|Careful of that barnacle, Alyx.
|05_00103
|-
|Does it have a skull and crossbones on it?
|05_00107
|-
|Probably medicine, then.
|05_00108
|-
|Alyx! Did you just inject yourself with something you found on the ground?
|05_00109
|-
|Yeah, yeah, that's where they keep it.
|05_00110
|-
|That's the control panel. They've probably scrambled the circuit. But considering no one would be dumb enough to open the hatch, it shouldn't be too hard to put back.
|05_00111
|-
|You'll go through the old subway tunnels on your way to the train yard.
|05_00112
|-
|I don't think so. Which could be good news, because we've still got time.
|05_00113
|-
|Or bad news, because they've already killed him. And you don't need to move a corpse. You just bury it. Or burn it. You still there, Alyx?
|05_00114
|-
|Ahh, right. The \
|05_00121
|-
|Ahh, right. So it can hack everything. If you give it enough time. Probably takes a while, though, right?
|05_00123
|-
|Can it manipulate gravity at a distance?
|05_00124
|-
|Right. Didn't think so. Not in glove form either, I noticed.
|05_00125
|-
|Alright, 'nuff chit-chat, we've gotta go and save your dad. Come on.
|05_00126
|-
|Yeah. Well, no. Tricky place to get a job at. I interviewed at Black Mesa. They said try again in a year. I don't need to tell you what happened after that. Lucky break for me, really. Not a lot of survivors. Honestly, it's a miracle you and your dad got out of there.
|05_00127
|-
|Alyx? You cut out for a while. What happened?
|05_00128
|-
|A Vortigaunt? What was he doing down there?
|05_00129
|-
|Oh! Great! What did it taste like? Tell me how you f
|05_00130
|-
|Right. Of course you didn't. No, that's that's the right decision.
|05_00131
|-
|Yes, Alyx?
|05_00157
|-
|Ah! Excellent. Alyx, have you ever heard of a club sandwich?
|05_00158
|-
|Right. To make a club sandwich, you need to start with bread. Not from a bread line. From a bakery across the street, baked that day, okay? You add tomatoes, lettuce  not vegetable paste  fresh. Then you add bacon  that's from an animal we used to call the \
|05_00159
|-
|It is! And I'm not done. Then you add a second sandwich on top of the first one. You put ham in it  also from a pig  and turkey, from an animal we used to call the \
|05_00160
|-
|This is Eli
|05_00162
|-
|Close
|05_00165
|-
|and flick.
|05_00166
|-
|Don't worry, it's unloaded!
|05_00167
|-
|You do? Okay. Good. Well Successful experiment. Keep an eye out for more.
|05_00168
|-
|I know, right?
|05_00169
|-
|Well, that's the crazy thing, I don't know! Just blurry pictures of a building.
|05_00200
|-
|Nah, something else. And whatever it is, they're gonna kill anybody who saw it, and anybody who knows anybody who saw it. Which means us and your dad.
|05_00201
|-
|I know. This this is bad. They're gonna find out what he knows, and then Yeah, they're gonna kill him.
|05_00202
|-
|But! The good news is, we've got something they don't.
|05_00203
|-
|My plan to get him back!
|05_00204
|-
|Right. Good, well that's the that's the main
|05_00205
|-
|It's unloaded now!
|05_00074
|-
|That's it.
|05_00300
|-
|Boom, yep.
|05_00301
|-
|You're on it.
|05_00302
|-
|Targeted.
|05_00303
|-
|You're attached.
|05_00304
|-
|Yep, you're tethered.
|05_00305
|-
|Close your hand.
|05_00306
|-
|Now close it.
|05_00307
|-
|Make a grip.
|05_00308
|-
|Now close your hand.
|05_00309
|-
|Great.
|05_00310
|-
|Yep.
|05_00311
|-
|That's it.
|05_00312
|-
|Just like that.
|05_00313
|-
|Perfect.
|05_00314
|-
|Again, but catch it.
|05_00315
|-
|But catch it.
|05_00316
|-
|Now catch it.
|05_00318
|-
|Try catching it.
|05_00319
|-
|Catch it.
|05_00320
|-
|Alyx, imagine there's a, like a, trigger on, ah on the \
|05_00321
|-
|Now aim your hand
|05_00322
|-
|Pull the trigger
|05_00323
|-
|And there you go.
|05_00324
|-
|Alyx, there should be a small trigger near the index finger on each of your Russells.
|05_00325
|-
|Oh. Almost forgot, guns need ammo.
|05_00327
|-
|Here you go!
|05_00328
|-
|Alyx, up here! Heads up, throwing down some ammo.
|05_00329
|-
|Here you go.
|05_00330
|-
|Oh, you uh, took care of that lock, then. Good. Great. Did have the key for it. But should've given you that, that's that's on me.
|05_00333
|-
|Good, because we don't have much time.
|05_00342
|-
|There's a control station override nearby.
|05_00343
|-
|Alyx, that's the control panel right there.
|05_00344
|-
|If you can bring the system back to life I should be able to stop Eli's train.
|05_00345
|-
|Alyx, that's the control panel!
|05_00346
|-
|That's the opposite of what it's supposed to do, Alyx!
|05_00350
|-
|Uh well don't panic! Or stop panicking! If-If you are.
|05_00352
|-
|Okay, just throw the switch, there.
|05_00362
|-
|You've got to hold it down!
|05_00363
|-
|Quickly, Alyx!
|05_00364
|-
|Good! Now keep the lever held down otherwise the track will switch back.
|05_00365
|-
|Hold it down, Alyx!
|05_00366
|-
|Good God!
|05_00367
|-
|Yeah. Wow. You okay?
|05_00368
|-
|Just shoot them, Alyx!
|05_00378
|-
|Great, now go inside and deactivate the power source.
|05_00379
|-
|Good grief, it's a Vortigaunt
|05_00380
|-
|You've got it.
|05_00395
|-
|to Nova Prospekt.
|05_00396
|-
|What IS this?
|05_00398
|-
|Hello, Alyx? We MIGHT have a problem. Probably nothing to worry about, but
|05_00334
|-
|Did the train stop? It stopped, didn't it.
|05_00335
|-
|Ugh, it's jammed. When the Combine shut down the Quarantine Zone, they must have tightened security.
|05_00336
|-
|Yeah, you're nowhere near Fairview Junction. You're just outside the QZ.
|05_00337
|-
|And THIS is as far as we get by train.
|05_00338
|-
|Watch it, Alyx!
|05_00388
|-
|Alyx, look out!
|05_00389
|-
|Dead ahead!
|05_00390
|-
|Incoming!
|05_00391
|-
|Combine!
|05_00393
|-
|You've got company.
|05_00394
|-
|We'll talk later.
|05_00400
|-
|Let's talk later.
|05_00403
|-
|Go get 'em!
|05_00404
|-
|Yeah yeah, go.
|05_00405
|-
|And if there's resin around here, there should be a Combine fabricator. Keep an eye out, we might be able to upgrade your firepower a bit.
|05_00411
|-
|Alyx! I think that's a Combine fabricator. Put something in it, I want to see how this thing works.
|05_00412
|-
|Headcrab!
|05_00414
|-
|Wait  where'd it go?
|05_00415
|-
|Aah!
|05_00416
|-
|Yep. There it is. Found it.
|05_00417
|-
|Do you hear that?
|05_00418
|-
|Yeah. That's that's the way we gotta go.
|05_00419
|-
|Yeah, that IS the shortcut.
|05_00420
|-
|Yeah, that's also the long way.
|05_00421
|-
|Alright, that seemed to work. Let's keep doing that.
|05_00422
|-
|[Laughs]
|05_00423
|-
|Ha ha! That barnacle's on our side. It's not though, obviously, so don't walk under them.
|05_00424
|-
|Nice shooting, Alyx.
|05_00426
|-
|Ah, possibly. Are you seeing floating garbage?
|05_00429
|-
|Right. Well, seems harmless.
|05_00430
|-
|Alyx! You alright? What's wrong?
|05_00431
|-
|I'm losing your signal! Alyx? Alyx? If you can still hear me, keep heading in the same direction, and-and try to get above ground!
|05_00432
|-
|Alyx! Alyx! The signal's back! Can you hear me? Are you okay?
|05_00433
|-
|Ten seconds, Alyx!
|05_00434
|-
|Train's here in ten seconds, Alyx!
|05_00435
|-
|Five seconds!
|05_00436
|-
|Four!
|05_00437
|-
|Three!
|05_00438
|-
|Two!
|05_00439
|-
|One!
|05_00440
|-
|Well actually, the word quarantine comes from the Italian, \
|05_00453
|-
|Yeah, yeah it is.
|05_00456
|-
|Alyx. I'm seeing a high concentration of anti-particles radiating off that thing. Just warning you. Quantum-wise, it might get weird in there.
|05_00459
|-
|Yeah.
|05_00460
|-
|Yes.
|05_00461
|-
|That's good. Good. That's great.
|05_00462
|-
|Yes. Absolutely.
|05_00463
|-
|Yep! Crystal clear!
|05_00464
|-
|You're extremely good at killing aliens!
|05_00465
|-
|It's alarming, actually!
|05_00466
|-
|Yep, could always get worse.
|05_00467
|-
|Ooh, that's a toughie. I don't know, uh, good day? I'd say six. Yeah, strong six.
|05_00468
|-
|Well, that's life, Alyx. You know, it's not always great.
|05_00469
|-
|Ooh, an eight. Yeah, that'd really would be nice. Really nice.
|05_00470
|-
|I'm going full production mode on the \
|05_00471
|-
|Goldmine, yep. So here's the plan, conservative estimate, I figure one year to get the world unconquered by the Combine, get them off the planet. So that's year one.
|05_00472
|-
|Then another year to mass produce the \
|05_00473
|-
|So uh, yeah THREE year plan. Let's slot the infrastructure thing in for year two.
|05_00474
|-
|Ooh, well, uh Hmm. Well, there would be stock options. Five to ten year vesting period, obviously. Could be very lucrative for you, Alyx. In the long term.
|05_00476
|-
|Yep. Sounds good Alyx.
|05_00477
|-
|So once we get the combine off the Earth, what are you gonna do with yourself, Alyx?
|05_00478
|-
|Well, it wouldn't actually have to be secret. You could just live your life out in the open.
|05_00479
|-
|Well no, there'll still be criminals. Just no aliens.
|05_00480
|-
|So I'd say a yes on the doors and locks just uh yeah. Just for caution. And keep the gun.
|05_00481
|-
|Job? Alyx, you invented the \
|05_00482
|-
|That's your dad's prisoner pod.
|05_00600
|-
|Oh God.
|05_00602
|-
|Alyx, hurry!
|05_00603
|-
|Oh jeez, oh jeez.
|05_00605
|-
|Agh!
|05_00606
|-
|Wait a  hm. Where IS the Vault?
|05_00607
|-
|I'm with you every step of the way.
|05_00608
|-
|Agh!
|05_00700
|-
|Oof!
|05_00701
|-
|Whoa!
|05_00702
|-
|Aah!
|05_00703
|-
|No, but it should fix up that pistol nicely. Good thing too, I gave you one of my lesser guns.
|05_00705
|-
|You owe me a gun anyway! That wasn't a gift. That's MY gun.
|05_00706
|-
|Wait, is that a dead Combine soldier?
|05_00707
|-
|Oh, keep an eye out. Something's definitely up.
|05_00709
|-
|Agh! Oh God!
|05_00712
|-
|Get it off!
|05_00713
|-
|It's disgusting!
|05_00714
|-
|Ugh, it's horrific!
|05_00715
|-
|Oh, thank God.
|05_00717
|-
|Ugh, Alyx, that was vile
|05_00718
|-
|Yeah, they're putting him on the train now. Which is good. Because it means he's still alive.
|05_00728
|-
|No. Radio silence since he got on the train.
|05_00729
|-
|Well, the good news is, they're going to torture him when they get to Nova Prospekt.
|05_00730
|-
|Because logically speaking, they have no reason to do it on the train ride there.
|05_00731
|-
|Well, the good news is he's probably fine.
|05_00732
|-
|Because they're taking him to Nova Prospekt to torture him. That's the torture place. So they're hardly gonna torture him before they GET there. So he's fine. Logically speaking.
|05_00733
|-
|They've got him on the train. He's on the move. You gotta find Fairview Junction before they get there.
|05_00734
|-
|So anything happen when you cut out?
|05_00735
|-
|A Vortigaunt? What was he doing down there?
|05_00736
|-
|W-what did he say?
|05_00737
|-
|What the hell are those?
|05_00738
|-
|Yeaahhh
|05_00739
|-
|Uh, that's probably gonna draw some attention. Not probably, actually. It's definitely drawing attention. Look, they're looking for you now. Okay? So just be careful.
|05_00740
|-
|Alyx! Look out the window!
|05_00741
|-
|I'm serious, Alyx. Look out the window. Is that what I think it is?
|05_00742
|-
|Okay, good. You found it. Now go look out the window. Come on. I can't look at it unless you do.
|05_00743
|-
|Yeah. Your dad didn't mention it was floating.
|05_00744
|-
|The cables! Look at all the cables attached to it.
|05_00745
|-
|All we have to do is follow them
|05_00746
|-
|And down comes the Vault. Simple. Easy to follow. Yeah, I like this plan.
|05_00747
|-
|Alright, you  for a good reason, I'm sure  refused to look out the window.
|05_00748
|-
|So forget the window. On the other side of it was the VAULT your dad wanted us to look for. It's floating in the air, which makes it tricky for us to get to.
|05_00749
|-
|But! It's covered in cables. I reckon if we follow the cables and destroy whatever they're connected to we should be able to bring the Vault down.
|05_00750
|-
|No, I don't think so.
|05_00751
|-
|I am. Why are you saying it like that?
|05_00753
|-
|Ohhh. Yeah, that does make more sense.
|05_00754
|-
|Hmm. That's some sort of Combine substation. They usually generate power and host security protocols.
|05_00755
|-
|Yeah, that substation must be what's keeping it in the air. We need to get up there.
|05_00756
|-
|There's no way they'd leave an unsecured entrance on the street.
|05_00757
|-
|Find a way into the hotel and make your way to the roof.
|05_00758
|-
|Alyx, I think you should find your way into that hotel and get up to the substation.
|05_00759
|-
|Ooh! Elevator. That's our way up.
|05_00760
|-
|Ah. Get to the roof. Find the substation.
|05_00761
|-
|Okay, now just make your  to the roof and get access to that station.
|05_00762
|-
|There's a lift, there, but it's going to be a pain to restore the power.
|05_00763
|-
|Yeah, I-I-I get it.
|05_00764
|-
|Ohhh.
|05_00765
|-
|Comm channel's gone crazy since we took out that substation. They know we're after the Vault now. Whatever's in there, they really REALLY don't want us to have it.
|05_00766
|-
|Now that's the spirit.
|05_00767
|-
|We're putting a lot of trust in that Vortigaunt to shut down all the substations.
|05_00768
|-
|Yes. Me too. Uh because if he doesn't, that Vault isn't going anywhere. And we'll be standing there, with no Vault to break into, surrounded by Combine, and
|05_00769
|-
|Yes. You're right. He'll be fine. We're all going to be fine.
|05_00770
|-
|Okay, there's no direct path from where you are to the Vault. So you're going to have to snake your way there.
|05_00771
|-
|My guess is they're trying to find a way to ship it off Earth. Back to their home or some other planet.
|05_00772
|-
|They already won this war, Alyx.
|05_00773
|-
|Whoa, Alyx!
|05_00774
|-
|The Vortigaunts are taking down the substation!
|05_00775
|-
|This might work.
|05_00776
|-
|Alyx! Drone's back in action! From up here it looks like there's Combine barricades up ahead that are stopping anyone from getting any closer to the Vault.
|05_00777
|-
|Make your way into the distillery and see where it takes you. With my drone back online we've finally got the upper  oh no, you're kidding me!
|05_00778
|-
|Oh, you're kidding me!
|05_00779
|-
|It's a distillery. They made vodka and things like that.
|05_00781
|-
|Oh God, no.
|05_00782
|-
|Well, I  I never said that!
|05_00783
|-
|It's poison
|05_00784
|-
|but I love it. Everyone everyone loves it.
|05_00785
|-
|Wonderful if you if you could, actually, yes.
|05_00786
|-
|It only improves! It's all good, Alyx!
|05_00787
|-
|The vodka's good, Alyx! The vodka is good!
|05_00788
|-
|Alyx! Come in, Alyx! Alyx? Ah, there you are. There you are.
|05_00789
|-
|Oh good! That's great news!
|05_00790
|-
|Okay, uh, well if I cut out again, remember: Vodka doesn't go off, okay? Lasts forever.
|05_00791
|-
|Alyx, you're never going to believe
|05_00792
|-
|Alyx, come in. Hey Alyx! Oh, there you are. Can you hear me?
|05_00793
|-
|I think you're still in the distillery.
|05_00794
|-
|Well, that's great. We can take all the help we can get.
|05_00795
|-
|Good! Uh, I'll try and figure out where it leads.
|05_00796
|-
|I found a bunch of subterranean map data for your area of the city!
|05_00797
|-
|Subterranean. It means underground. You know, underneath. Alyx? Alyx?
|05_00798
|-
|Good news: that tunnel heads to the Vault.
|05_00800
|-
|Antlions, antlions, antlions
|05_00801
|-
|Oh! Yes! And very small, like ants!
|05_00802
|-
|Uh, like tiny, little lions.
|05_00803
|-
|Right. Uh well, whatever they are, they're down that tunnel.
|05_00804
|-
|Leggie! Oh no, it's dead.
|05_00806
|-
|Kill the leggie!
|05_00807
|-
|That's an antlion?
|05_00808
|-
|Yes. They're leggies.
|05_00809
|-
|Yes! Leggies! And they're bloody deadly, Alyx, be careful!
|05_00810
|-
|Alyx! Look!
|05_00811
|-
|I don't understand. All that Vortigaunt energy. If it wasn't holding up the Vault, what was it doing?
|05_00813
|-
|Well: Vault brought down. That was the tricky part. Now's the easy part: Grab what's inside.
|05_00814
|-
|Fair enough. Well. Let's go do the easy part: grabbing what's inside. Eli? What's inside?
|05_00815
|-
|A Strider. Deactivated, though. Lucky break there. Could you imagine that thing blocking your way?
|05_00816
|-
|Alyx! The Strider! Look out, it's alive!
|05_00817
|-
|Argh. I did jinx us, didn't I?
|05_00818
|-
|Agh!
|05_00819
|-
|Ahh.
|05_00820
|-
|Do you uh, think it's dead?
|05_00821
|-
|I think I've got an idea.
|05_00822
|-
|Get it! Get at it! Shoot it! Shoot it!
|05_00823
|-
|Ha! It's working! I think it's working. It doesn't look happy about getting shot, anyway. Keep shooting it!
|05_00824
|-
|Go, go, yes! Yes! Keep shooting! That's the way! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Oh yes!
|05_00825
|-
|What  why?
|05_00830
|-
|Oh! Your dad's back!
|05_00831
|-
|Did you see where it went?
|05_00836
|-
|I think it's on the hood of that car, there.
|05_00837
|-
|Should be somewhere on the ground there.
|05_00838
|-
|Right! Heading back to the comm room.
|05_00839
|-
|Here you go!
|05_00843
|-
|Heads up!
|05_00844
|-
|There you go!
|05_00845
|-
|Hey, that's my window! Watch it!
|05_00846
|-
|No, nothing. It's all about sending reinforcements into the Quarantine Zone.
|05_00900
|-
|And on the downside
|05_00901
|-
|Yeah, no, I-I know. I've just never seen those before.
|05_00902
|-
|So much pressure in fact that I Well, I hesitate to even bring up. But I did notice when you reached out for your father's hand, had he actually grabbed it, his grip would have crushed all the delicate sensors in the \
|05_00903
|-
|Totally understandable  and would have been worth it, by the way  in this case.
|05_00904
|-
|Having said that, I have a hard time imagining ANOTHER situation where that would have been the case. And uh, much like your father, the Russells ARE priceless, okay, so just you know, moving forward.
|05_00905
|-
|We can take a shortcut through that building.
|05_00907
|-
|Woooo!
|05_00909
|-
|I'm recording it, Alyx! Don't look away! Look directly at it for posterity!
|05_00910
|-
|Well, keep an eye out. There's no shortage of dead folks around here, and  well, not to put too fine a point on it, but they don't need their ammo anymore.
|05_00914
|-
|Great. Now put it on the map.
|05_00917
|-
|Aah!
|05_00919
|-
|It looks as if there are Combine barricades up ahead. They're stopping anyone from getting any closer to the Vault.
|05_00925
|-
|Alyx! Look up!
|05_01000
|-
|Look up, look up!
|05_01001
|-
|Look who's back! I got the drone up and running again!
|05_01002
|-
|Ignore that. We'll meet you outside.
|05_01003
|-
|Oh, no worries, more ammo where that came from.
|05_01004
|-
|Just to let you know, though, uhhh not infinite supplies up here. Okay? Just as a cautionary warning there.
|05_01006
|-
|And not only that. Someone's hacked into the Combine construction network.
|05_02000
|-
|One minute and I'm out. Guaranteed.
|05_02001
|-
|I think it landed on the hood of the car there.
|05_02002
|-
|A Vort! It's a Vort!
|05_02006
|-
|That's the brand name, Alyx.
|05_02003
|-
|Yeah, you know, the catchy household name. I'm gonna make a fortune off these things once we get the Combine off Earth and things are back to normal.
|05_02004
|-
|Anything look like a breaker box in there?
|05_02009
|-
|Well, it is spores from another dimension, so probably yeah, extremely.
|05_02010
|-
|But! A rare opportunity to examine alien flora up close.
|05_02011
|-
|Oh! Careful of those pustule things!
|05_02012
|-
|They're looking a bit ticked off the closer you get.
|05_02013
|-
|Ugh.
|05_02014
|-
|Agreed. Just keep moving.
|05_02015
|-
|Maybe breathe less.
|05_02016
|-
|Alyx, what does it feel like?
|05_02017
|-
|How'd that feel?
|05_02018
|-
|How sharp?
|05_02019
|-
|Okay, six.
|05_02021
|-
|[Signal Noise] Alyx! Alyx! What happened?
|05_02022
|-
|[Intermittent Signal Noise] Alyx? Alyx, come in.
|05_02023
|-
|Ah, I'm sorry I missed that.
|05_02024
|-
|Ooh, look at that. Huh. Interesting.
|05_02025
|-
|Be careful, Alyx!
|05_02026
|-
|No!
|05_02027
|-
|It sounds nuts.
|05_02028
|-
|Those Combine shield doors are effectively impa  [Signal Dissolving]
|05_02029
|-
|[Signal Noise] Alyx! Is the dog gone? What happened?
|05_02030
|-
|[Signal Noise] Did that dog come back again, Alyx?
|05_02031
|-
|You're alright, though, right?
|05_02032
|-
|Well we've gotta get you out of here and up to the roof.
|05_02033
|-
|Ah, thank heavens.
|05_02034
|-
|Yeah, you're going to have to get past this Combine wall.
|05_02038
|-
|Alright, I'll be able to stop the train right here.
|05_02058
|-
|Absolutely. You just need to activate the terminal.
|05_02059
|-
|Then you'll need to be ready for a fight. They're not gonna give up your dad easily.
|05_02060
|-
|Right. That's the terminal there.
|05_02061
|-
|Do hurry, though.
|05_02062
|-
|Okay, no worries, but the train is coming.
|05_02063
|-
|Just get me in, it'll only take a second. You're doing great.
|05_02064
|-
|Okay! Now just re-engage the system.
|05_02065
|-
|Yes, but I am! We need to find another way to stop this train!
|05_02067
|-
|Good! Mystery lever! I love it!
|05_02068
|-
|What's it do?
|05_02069
|-
|Oh. So Eli's train will be redirected to
|05_02070
|-
|Right! Oh yes! He's in a prisoner pod! He'll be fine! Hurry, Alyx!
|05_02071
|-
|Well, start looking! We don't have much time!
|05_02073
|-
|Pull it! See what it does!
|05_02074
|-
|I'll let you know if he gets here  Ah, WHEN. When he gets here.
|05_02076
|-
|Well, when it comes to Combine data encryption
|05_02082
|-
|Eli's your guy!
|05_02083
|-
|Systems, robotics, networks I can make short work of those.
|05_02084
|-
|Might as well be an alien language. Well, it is an alien language. Anyway look, Eli's your guy.
|05_02085
|-
|Good luck trying to lock out someone wielding an \
|05_02087
|-
|Oh! Let me see! Eli! The Vorts just took down the last substation!
|05_02092
|-
|It's  they've activated some sort of emergency backup.
|05_02093
|-
|They've activated a backup!
|05_02094
|-
|Your dad says
|05_02095
|-
|The Vault's right there. Just go in and get him. Or what's left of him.
|05_02106
|-
|Your what?
|05_02200
|-
|Alyx, that thing's incredible! You need an incredible brand name! Something that really sells it!
|05_02201
|-
|The Combine's not going to be here forever. You should be thinking about the future, Alyx!
|05_02202
|-
|Hmm. It's a little derivative of the \
|05_02203
|-
|Ha ha! There we go. Finally.
|05_02204
|-
|Right! Yes! He's in a prisoner pod! He'll be fine!
|05_02206
|-
|Hold it down! Keep it held!
|05_02207
|-
|[Signal Noise] Hmm. That was weird.
|05_02208
|-
|Let's try and get that power back on.
|05_02209
|-
|This hotel's ancient. The wiring's gonna be a real rat's nest.
|05_02210
|-
|That's okay. You could pick some up on the way back.
|05_02214
|-
|I do. But you do have two hands. Could you pick up a SECOND on the way back?
|05_02215
|-
|Right. That's gotta be the backup station.
|05_02216
|-
|What's that, Alyx?
|05_02217
|-
|Whoa.
|05_02218
|-
|Absolutely. Be specific.
|05_02219
|-
|Right. Well, to make a club sandwich, you needed to start with bread. Not from a breadline, from a bakery.
|05_02220
|-
|You're welcome, Alyx.
|05_02221
|-
|Yeah?
|05_02222
|-
|About what?
|05_02223
|-
|Well, I think that given our situation, your irrational fear of the dark is actually quite appropriate. You know, I can give you easily a hundred reasons to be terrified.
|05_02224
|-
|You should have plenty of time to get the override back online.
|05_02228
|-
|Survived Black Mesa then disappeared Eli! They DO have a superweapon!
|05_02232
|-
|This is this is a miracle.
|05_02233
|-
|Me too.
|05_02234
|-
|Well, he saved humanity once. I'm willing to bet he can do it again.
|05_02235
|-
|Almost certainly. Just pick one. Immediately.
|05_02237
|-
|No not that one.
|05_02238
|-
|No, that's not the bridge.
|05_02239
|-
|Alyx, the bridge isn't moving. Why is the bridge not moving?
|05_02240
|-
|Nope.
|05_02241
|-
|Worse nope.
|05_02242
|-
|Oh God.
|05_02243
|-
|Alyx Alyx
|05_02244
|-
|Alyx ALYX ALYX!
|05_02245
|-
|I'm talking \
|05_02246
|-
|Now, Alyx.
|05_02247
|-
|Alyx, please, just pick one.
|05_02248
|-
|If I was the Combine, where would I put a control panel?
|05_02259
|-
|Ah yeah, I use them all the time.
|05_02261
|-
|Yeah, they're great.
|05_02262
|-
|Just put your hand in there.
|05_02263
|-
|Look, honestly, just pull the handle and put your hand in there.
|05_02264
|-
|Yeah, I use them all the time. Just find a power cell.
|05_02265
|-
|Alright my friend, you are good to go.
|05_02266
|-
|Alyx! Manhack! Watch out!
|05_02267
|-
|Manhack!
|05_02268
|-
|Oop, manhacks!
|05_02269
|-
|Worth it.
|05_02272
|-
|So close!
|05_02273
|-
|Really close that time.
|05_02274
|-
|Yes!
|05_02275
|-
|Nice throw!
|05_02276
|-
|Well done!
|05_02277
|-
|Oof. Alright, Alyx. That tractor beam over there looks like it'll get you up to the Vault.
|05_02290
|-
|[Signal Dissolving] Argh. Its throwing off a lot of interference. Probably wont be able to talk to you in there.
|05_02291
|-
|[Signal Dissolving] So this is it.
|05_02292
|-
|[Signal Dissolving] Then you'll come back out, with Gordon, safe and sound, so everything is going to be
|05_02293
|-
|Brace yourself, Alyx! It's going to come down!
|05_03000
|-
|What now?
|05_03001
|-
|Wow! My gun's looking pretty good!
|05_03500
|-
|Oh wow, check it out! My gun just keeps getting better and better.
|05_03501
|-
|Hmm. I'll tell you what: Let's put that idea on hold for now. We can chat about MY gun when you get back.
|05_03502
|-
|Alright. Fair enough. You earned it. I still want those \
|05_03503
|-
|Do you hear that?
|05_04001
|-
|Hurry up and load that thing, it's getting louder!
|05_04002
|-
|I love this gun.
|05_04003
|-
|Looks like they're milking the leggies
|05_02040
|-
|No, no no no, absolutely not. Why, were you considering it?
|05_02045
|-
|Look, don't waste your ammo! You'll never put a dent in that thing.
|05_02047
|-
|Bless you.
|05_02107
|-
|What the hell is that?!
|05_02211
|-
|Oh. That's Jeff. I do not like Jeff.
|05_02212
|-
|Oh. Okay. Right  I don't like Jeff.
|05_02213
|-
|That's not Combine. Maybe a scavenger? Be careful.
|05_02229
|-
|Eli, come here!
|05_02230
|-
|Eli! Come here!
|05_02231
|-
|I see it  we're almost there.
|05_02236
|-
|Likewise! Ah, this is great.
|05_02249
|-
|Honestly, I'd pegged your survival at about four percent.
|05_02250
|-
|Yep, it's right over there.
|05_02251
|-
|What is it?
|05_02252
|-
|Oh! A health station.
|05_02260
|-
|Wait, th-that one's Black Mesa?
|05_02271
|-
|Yeah, she sounds like she means business.
|05_02278
|-
|Yeah, we did. We did it.
|05_02281
|-
|Oh. Uh  do you need a minute? 'Cause uh, I mean, I could  I could pause the feed
|05_04500
|-
|What do you suppose this is?
|05_04501
|-
|Oh, crap.
|05_04502
|-
|Oh, just so you know  the Russells have a built-in display. Shows your resin, ammo. You know, might come in handy.
|05_04503
|-
|Yeah, be careful.
|05_04504
|-
|Alyx! Behind that door! I think it's a Combine fabricator!
|05_04505
|-
|Oh! That should come in handy.
|05_04506
|-
|Well. That was worth the resin.
|05_04507
|-
|The Combine do know how to upgrade a gun. I'll give 'em that.
|05_04508
|-
|You can put that to good use.
|05_04509
|-
|Now that will be useful.
|05_04510
|-
|Looking very deadly.
|05_04512
|-
|Very nice. I almost wish I was there so I could have a go with that.
|05_04513
|-
|Probably only one of those.
|05_04514
|-
|Okay, two. Two of those.
|05_04515
|-
|Ahh, health station!
|05_04517
|-
|Hm. It's not working.
|05_04518
|-
|That there is a \
|05_04519
|-
|Specifically, two micrometers magnetic iron oxide, three micrometers barium ferrite, and one point two
|05_04520
|-
|I'm reading it here on my computer. I downloaded the internet before the war.
|05_04521
|-
|Ehh, most of it.
|05_04522
|-
|Everything alright?
|05_04523
|-
|Whoa! Careful! Careful!
|05_04524
|-
|Steady
|05_04525
|-
|Yeah, there must be a battery around here somewhere.
|05_04527
|-
|The override has to be outside, Alyx! Hurry!
|05_04528
|-
|Look for a switch!
|05_04529
|-
|Keep looking for a switch! We've got to stop that train!
|05_04530
|-
|You know, if we can get this weapon, we could change things forever.
|05_04531
|-
|Look, I know we've only been working together for a few hours now, but  I want you to know I'm proud of you. Okay? You're under a lot of pressure here.
|05_04532
|-
|[Chuckles]
|05_04533
|-
|Hey! On the monitor. Combine.
|05_04534
|-
|Oh God. Don't look down. Don't look down!
|05_04535
|-
|Listen, there should be a big tunnel-sized plug in the floor there somewhere. That's gonna be
|05_04536
|-
|Correct. You get it open, I'll figure out where it leads.
|05_04537
|-
|Okay, the coast is clear. Time to get that plug open so we can get out through those tunnels.
|05_04538
|-
|Try and find a console.
|05_04539
|-
|Look for a blinking light.
|05_04540
|-
|Honestly, if there's a gorilla on the loose I'm not sure a headcrab's gonna make it much worse.
|05_04541
|-
|Alyx, dead ahead. Those controls dock the Vault to the station.
|05_04542
|-
|Oh, really? What does it reek like? Be specific.
|05_04546
|-
|But what if it cures cancer?
|05_04553
|-
|What if it gives you a new type of cancer?
|05_04554
|-
|Fine.
|05_04555
|-
|Too dark. You'll need a flashlight.
|05_04560
|-
|Nicely done.
|05_04561
|-
|Good job.
|05_04562
|-
|Aaand there we go.
|05_04563
|-
|That's it.
|05_04564
|-
|Uh huh. Perfect.
|05_04565
|-
|Okay. Made quick work of that.
|05_04566
|-
|That did it.
|05_04567
|-
|That seemed to work.
|05_04568
|-
|There you go.
|05_04569
|-
|Maybe it's missing a piece?
|05_04599
|-
|Right. Look for the prisoner transport car. It should be towards the front of the train.
|05_04600
|-
|Well done.
|05_04670
|-
|Keep looking.
|05_04671
|-
|Must be around here somewhere.
|05_04672
|-
|You see anything? I can't see anything.
|05_04674
|-
|It must be here.
|05_04675
|-
|Careful
|05_04676
|-
|One down.
|05_04678
|-
|You've almost got it.
|05_04679
|-
|Almost hacked
|05_04681
|-
|Oh, thank God, a health station.
|05_20111
|-
|Ah!
|05_20112
|-
|Go look outside! There HAS to be a manual override. Well, technically there doesn't have to be one. But, you know, it'd be nice if there was. Please. [Chuckles Nervously]
|05_20110
|-
|Mixed with ammonia. Okay.
|05_94547
|-
|It's missing a piece!
|05_94599
|-
|Excellent choice.
|05_95000
|-
|Smart. That'll come in handy.
|05_95001
|-
|That should win some arguments.
|05_95002
|-
|Wouldn't want to be on the wrong side of that.
|05_95003
|-
|Now that is upgraded.
|05_95004
|-
|That is about as deadly as that thing's gonna get.
|05_95005
|-
|Yeah that's actually pretty good, isn't it? Heck, I think I gave you the wrong gun.
|05_95006
|-
|They're alien commandos, of course they have automatic weapons.
|05_95007
|-
|We'd have them too but Combine weapons are gene-coded, so, out of luck. Unless! You find one that's unbonded. Or you're open to some minor genetic modification.
|05_95008
|-
|Listen to this...
|05_95009
|-
|Yeah, that's not good.
|05_95011
|-
|You're gonna have to find the power source for that barrier there.
|05_95012
|-
|There's a Combine Shield blocking your path.
|05_95013
|-
|Well, let's think about it, Alyx. He's on foot, moving at three miles an hour...
|05_95014
|-
|Plus he's a fugitive, he's only got one leg... There's obstacles, no direct path... Uh, you know what? I'm not gonna lie to you, he SHOULD be back by now.
|05_95015
|-
|Normally, yes. But you're the one headed TOWARDS the danger, so I'd say we should be the ones worried about you.
|05_95016
|-
|Alyx! It's your lucky day! That Combine weapon's unbonded!
|05_95017
|-
|It's still in the case! They never leave them in the case.
|05_95018
|-
|I didn't even need to edit your genetic code.
|05_95019
|-
|It's okay, there'll be a next time.
|05_95020
|-
|Incoming, Alyx!
|05_95021
|-
|Got him.
|05_95022
|-
|You okay?
|05_95023
|-
|Yeahhh, no, I would probably die instantly.
|05_95024
|-
|Fairview Junction! We're here!
|05_95025
|-
|This is it!
|05_95026
|-
|Get down!
|05_95027
|-
|That's it!
|05_95029
|-
|Now just snip those cables and off we go.
|05_95030
|-
|Maybe try opening the cable shielding and shooting them.
|05_95031
|-
|There you go!
|05_95032
|-
|Incoming!
|05_95033
|-
|Incoming, Alyx!
|05_95034
|-
|Combine!
|05_95035
|-
|Alyx, look out!
|05_95036
|-
|Yeah, that's right.
|05_95037
|-
|And it, not unlike yourself, is also sensitive to the dark.
|05_95038
|-
|Meaning it should go on automatically when the lights go out.
|05_95039
|-
|Ah, well you know what they say about resin, Alyx.
|05_95040
|-
|Um. \
|05_95041
|-
|Yeah, that's the one \
|05_95042
|-
|Ooh, that really worked didn't it? Huh
|05_95043
|-
|That's a good question
|05_95044
|-
|Hmm. I think they're gonna move him off world.
|05_95045
|-
|Oh, you mean Gordon Freeman's crowbar?
|05_95046
|-
|Oh Alyx, he fought his way out of Black Mesa with nothing BUT that crowbar.
|05_95047
|-
|It's true! Well, it's true that that's what they say. You know, nobody knows for sure.
|05_95048
|-
|Yes! Uh  not mine. I'm out of the gun lending business, mmkay?
|05_95049
|-
|Yes! Not mine, though.
|05_95050
|-
|What's going o
|05_95051
|-
|Ah, h-he's fine, Alyx. He's working away over there.
|05_95052
|-
|Oh he IS missing a leg, though.
|05_95053
|-
|Right. Well, it's  it's still gone.
|05_95054
|-
|Sure thing.
|05_95055
|-
|Ah, your dad's heads-down. He's working on it. He's got to be close.
|05_95056
|-
|Great job, Alyx. They're throwing everything they've got at you.
|05_95057
|-
|We'd have them too, but Combine weapons are gene-coded, so, you know, we're out of luck. Unless you find one that's unbonded. Or you're open to some minor genetic modification.
|05_95061
|-
|Look, I really do.
|05_09990
|-
|Two bottles!
|05_09991
|-
|Three bottles!
|05_09993
|-
|Oh, you have gone above and beyond with what you've got there. It's reckless, excessive and deeply appreciated.
|05_09994
|-
|They're alien commandos, of course they have automatic weapons.
|05_95060
|-
|Alyx, we're getting close to the vault, now. You're not going to have many more chances to use your resin.
|05_99000
|-
|I can't believe my pistol's made it this far.
|05_99001
|-
|No, you're trying to rile me up. I won't fall for it. But in case you're not, give him the shotgun. Legend has it he's absolutely mental with a shotgun.
|05_99002
|-
|Alyx? Alyx, you still there?
|05_99003
|-
|Alyx? Alyx?
|05_99004
|-
|Alyx? ALYX!
|05_99005
|-
|ALYX!
|05_99006
|-
|Agh! Headcrab! A headcrab's on your face! Get it off your face, Alyx!
|05_99007
|-
|Ohhh, it's really on there!
|05_99009
|-
|Grab it! Hit it!
|05_99010
|-
|Hit it, Alyx! Knock it off your face!
|05_99011
|-
|Oh, thank God
|05_99012
|-
|It was on your face and it ugh, it was disgusting.
|05_99013
|-
|Just point your hand at something.
|05_99900
|-
|Find something to target with the \
|05_99901
|-
|Now target something with the \
|05_99902
|-
|Use your hand to target something.
|05_99903
|-
|All you've got to do is point your hand at something.
|05_99904
|-
|Just point at something with your hand to target.
|05_99905
|-
|Find an object and aim your hand at it.
|05_99906

|Alyx!
