Unable To Start Game
A game file appears to be missing or corrupted.  In the Steam client go to the game's properties.  In the 'Local Files' tab select 'Verify Integrity of Game Cache' to have Steam double-check the game's installation.
The system ran out of memory while loading the game.
Unable to find a valid Direct 3D device!
Check that your graphics driver is working properly,
and that you satisfy the minspecs of the game you are playing.
Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.
You might be using an old version of fraps which is incompatible with the game. Upgrade to Version 3.5.99 Build 15623 or later.
Error creating a D3D device! This can occur because of incompatibility with some 3rd party applications.
Change Rendering API
The game has detected that changing the rendering API to %s1 should increase your frame rate.
Changing this setting requires restarting the game, though, so approving the change means the game will exit this launch and try to restart after clicking yes.
Do you want the game to switch to the suggested rendering API?
If the game does not start properly after this change you can add -safe_mode to your launch options to override the change.
You can also change the rendering API setting later in the video settings.
Yes
OpenGL Support for Windows DLC required for OpenGL (-gl) mode.
Please download the OpenGL DLC and restart.
Failed to create an OpenGL context.
Your graphics card must support at least OpenGL v%s1.
Required OpenGL extension "%s1" is not supported.  Please update your OpenGL driver.
Vulkan Support DLC required for Vulkan (-vulkan) mode.
Please download the Vulkan DLC and restart.
Vulkan on macOS requires macOS v%s1 or greater.
Failed to initialize Vulkan.
Please make sure your driver and GPU support Vulkan.
To disable Vulkan, remove -vulkan from your launch options.
If you chose Vulkan in the video settings, please add -safe_mode to your launch options to allow the game to start with the default rendersystem.
Required Vulkan extension "%s1" is not supported.  Please update your Vulkan driver.
Not Enough Memory For Game
This device does not meet the minimum requirements.
The game requires at least %s1 of device memory to run reliably,
you may not be able to complete a game on this device.
The device appears to have %s2 of memory.
Unsupported Windows Version
This version of Windows is not supported, please upgrade to a newer version

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Puedo ver que estás ahí! ¡No veo razón para no ponerte el comunicador! ¡Alyx!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Esto no es un truco! ¡Es Russell! ¡Soy amigo de tu padre! ¡De la resistencia!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡No es un truco, Alyx!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! ¿Estás ahí?<cr>Tienes que seguir adelante.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Russell?
<clr:255,190,255>Tuve un accidente.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Ya sé! ¡Yo lo provoqué!<sb>Así que técnicamente no fue un accidente.<cr>Pero debes seguir.
<clr:255,190,255>Espera. Espera. ¿Dónde está papá?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Está bien. Sigue al dron.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Tienes que seguir adelante!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Vamos, Alyx!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, tienes que salir de ahí. Ya.
<clr:255,190,255>Ya, entendido.
<clr:255,190,255>Así que
papá está <I>bien<I>, ¿verdad?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pues... no.<cr>Para serte honesto, está en graves problemas.
<clr:255,190,255>Pero...
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Todavía lo tienen.<cr>Él iba en un transporte separado.
<clr:255,190,255> ¿Y tú me salvaste
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, sí.<sb>No tenía forma de saber a quién tenían en cada vehículo.<sb>Y
sí.<cr>El resultado fue que TE salvé.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Sabes a dónde lo llevan?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Retención criminal.<sb>Y después que se den cuenta que capturaron a Eli Vance
lo enviarán a Nova Prospekt.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pero ya estoy haciendo un plan para rescatarlo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Estás cerca de mi laboratorio.<sb>¡Solo sigue al dron!<cr>Ya veremos qué hacer.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, ¡te perdí por un segundo!<sb>No puedo ver la transmisión.<sb>¿Puedes ver dónde está mi dron?<sb>¿Está bien?
<clr:255,190,255>Eh, por supuesto. Sí.<cr>Estaré allí en un minuto.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell
<cr>¿Qué fue lo que ustedes <I>encontraron<I> allí?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Es lo más extraño, no tengo idea! Solo
fotos borrosas de un
edificio.
<clr:255,190,255>¿La Ciudadela?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, es algo distinto.<sb>Y lo que sea que tengan, van a matar a cualquiera que lo vea y a cualquiera que conozca a alguien que lo haya visto.<sb>Eso nos incluye a nosotros
y a tu padre.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell...<cr>aguanta, ya casi llego.
<clr:255,255,138>Alyx, genial.<cr>Muy bien, vamos a... espera.<cr>Mi dron está bien, ¿verdad?
<clr:255,190,255>Para nada. Explotó.<cr>Estoy bien, por cierto.
<clr:255,255,138>Sí. Bueno, eso es lo
<cr>eso es lo más importante
<clr:255,190,255>Russell. Tienen a papá.
<clr:255,255,138>Lo sé. Esto
esto no es bueno.<sb>Van a averiguar lo que sabe, y después
<cr>Sí, lo van a matar.
<clr:255,190,255>Oh, Dios
<clr:255,255,138>¡Pero!<sb>Las buenas noticias son que tenemos algo que ellos no tienen.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Y eso es
<clr:255,255,138>¡Mi plan para rescatarlo!
<clr:255,190,255>Genial. Escuchémoslo.
<clr:255,255,138>Ahora.<sb>Estoy seguro de que se darán cuenta de que tu padre no va a hablar.<sb>Y cuando ESO pase, le van a extraer el cerebro.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell.
<clr:255,255,138>Posiblemente.<sb>Tal vez no.<cr>Quiero decir que podría... ellos podrían taladrarle su...
<clr:255,190,255>Basta.
<clr:255,255,138>Ah. Sí. Aún es tu padre.<sb>Claro.<cr>Bueno, lo que sí van a hacer es meterlo en un tren desde AQUÍ
<clr:255,255,138>Este es Eli
<clr:255,255,138>a
Nova Prospekt.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Y una vez que esté en el tren
<cr>ahí se acaba todo, cierto?
<clr:255,255,138>No necesariamente.<cr>Toma algo para que nos represente.
<clr:255,255,138>Cualquier cosa sirve.
<clr:255,255,138>Lo que sea.
<clr:255,255,138>Genial. Ahora ponlo en el mapa.
<clr:255,255,138>Bueno, lo haré yo.
<clr:255,255,138>Okey, esa eres tú.
<clr:255,190,255>Pensé que te referías a "nosotros".
<clr:255,255,138>Bueno, UNO de nosotros... o sea yo... se va a tener que quedar para que este plan funcione.
<clr:255,190,255>Está bien, tiene sentido.
<clr:255,255,138>Justo aquí afuera, hay un segundo tren que también sale de la Ciudad 17 y pasa por la zona de cuarentena.
<clr:255,190,255>OK.
<clr:255,255,138>Ambos trenes se interceptan aquí en el Empalme Fairview.<sb>Tomas tu tren, llegas antes que su tren, y hackeas los controles.<sb>Eso me permitirá controlar el sistema.
<clr:255,255,138>El tren se detiene.<sb>Te encargas de los miembros de La Alianza.<sb>Y rescatamos a tu padre.
<clr:255,190,255>Me parece bien.<cr>¿En dónde está el tren que voy a tomar?
<clr:255,255,138>Está allí atrás, pasando el patio.<sb>Está decomisado, pero creo que puedo reprogramar los controles.
<clr:255,255,138>Ah sí, vas a necesitar un par de Russell antes de salir.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Los "Russell"?
<clr:255,255,138>Los guantes, Alyx.<sb>Los guantes de gravedad.<sb>Tengo varios pares por ahí.<sb>Puedes calibrarlos cerca del cobertizo.
<clr:255,190,255>Entendido.
<clr:255,255,138>Podemos lograrlo, Alyx.<sb>¿Sí escuchaste?<sb>¿Dije que lo vamos a lograr?<sb>Porque lo vamos a lograr.
<clr:255,190,255>Sí, lo lograremos.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Estaré contigo en cada paso que des.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Muy bien, sabes cómo funciona esto.<sb>Debería haber un montón de cosas donde estás.<sb>Apúntale a algo con tu mano abierta.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Solo apunta tu mano a algo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Los guantes no se van a calibrar solos.<sb>Aunque supongo que probablemente deberían.<sb>Eso es algo en lo que
debería trabajar.
<clr:255,190,255>Listo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora cierra tu mano y muévela hacia ti.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Solo mueve la muñeca.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Sí la estás moviendo? No puedo ver si la estás moviendo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cierra y mueve.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cierra
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>y mueve
<clr:255,190,255>Um. No funcionó.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Okey, el sensor de referencia está bastante desalineado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Inténtalo de nuevo.<sb>Elige un objetivo, apunta y abre la mano.
<clr:255,190,255>Aún no funciona.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Rayos.
<clr:255,190,255>Mmm, no.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Inténtalo de nuevo.
<clr:255,190,255>No.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Una vez más.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Elige un objetivo, apunta a él y abre la mano.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Excelente! Ahora cierra el puño.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien, ahora cierra el puño.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Qué te parece?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Se registró.<sb>Ahora mueve la muñeca hacia ti para atraerlo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Casi.<sb>Inténtalo de nuevo, pero atrápalo esta vez.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Muévela de nuevo e intenta atraparlo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Eso es.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Lo lograste.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bum, sí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Estás en ello.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ubicado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Estás conectada.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, estás enlazada.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cierra la mano.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora ciérrala.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cierra el puño.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora cierra tu mano.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Genial.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Justo así.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Perfecto.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Otra vez, pero atrápalo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pero atrápalo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora atrápalo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Intenta atraparlo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Atrápalo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, imagina que hay algo como un gatillo en los Russell.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Apunta con tu mano
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Aprieta el gatillo
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y ahí lo tienes.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, deberías sentir un pequeño gatillo cerca del dedo índice en cada Russell.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Perfecto, ya terminamos.<sb>¡Oh! Espera, casi lo olvido.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! ¡Aquí arriba!
<clr:255,255,138>¡Vas a necesitar un arma!
<clr:255,255,138>¡No te preocupes, está descargada!
<clr:255,255,138>¡Ahora está descargada!
<clr:255,255,138>¿No viste dónde cayó?
<clr:255,255,138>Creo que cayó sobre ese carro.
<clr:255,255,138>Oh. Casi se me olvida, tu pistola necesita munición.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Y ahí te va!
<clr:255,255,138>Debió caer por ahí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Creo que cayó sobre ese carro.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Perfecto! Voy a volver a la habitación de comunicación.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Russell? Me quedé sin balas.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Aquí tienes!
<clr:255,190,255>¿Oye, Russell? Eh
me quedé sin balas de nuevo.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Cuidado!
<clr:255,190,255>¿Russell? Me quedé sin balas otra vez.
<clr:255,255,138>No te preocupes, aquí tengo más municiones.
<clr:255,255,138>Solo déjame recordarte que no
tengo una cantidad infinita. ¿Okey? Solo... te aviso que esa es la situación.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Oye, ten cuidado! ¡Esa es mi ventana!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ah, te encargaste de ese candado.<sb>Bien. Genial.<sb>Yo tenía la llave.<sb>Pero no te la di, así que supongo que
<sb>fue mi culpa.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ese es el tren, Alyx.<sb>Intenta abrir la puerta.<sb>Ya casi consigo que el tren se active.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Hay manera de hackear la puerta?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Intenta abrir la puerta.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Muy bien! Aquí vamos.<sb>Siguiente parada: el Empalme Fairview.
<clr:255,190,255>Gracias, Russell.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Buena suerte, Alyx.<sb>Adiós.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Obviamente, solo para dejarte saber, sigo aquí.
<clr:255,190,255>Lo sé.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Hola, ¿Alyx? Creo que es POSIBLE que tengamos un problema.<cr>Tal vez no sea nada de qué preocuparse, pero...
<clr:255,190,255>¡Guau!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Frenó el tren?<cr>Se detuvo, ¿verdad?
<clr:255,190,255>Sí, ¿qué pasó?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No se está moviendo.<cr>Cuando la Alianza cerró la zona de cuarentena, debieron aumentar la seguridad.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Lo que significa?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pues... sí. Ni siquiera estás cerca del Empalme Fairview.<cr>Estás justo afuera de la zona de cuarentena.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>AQUÍ
es lo más lejos que vamos a llegar en tren.
<clr:255,190,255>Ya estoy caminando.
<clr:255,190,255>Entonces me voy a pie.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, veré si puedo encontrarte otra manera de continuar.
<clr:255,190,255>Aquí hay un zombi muerto.<sb>¿Pensé que la Alianza había sellado la zona de cuarentena?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Este se debió escapar.<sb>Escuché que tenían problemas con esporas de lapa fuera del área de contención.<sb>Pero no de amigos como este.
<clr:255,190,255>Entonces, es probable que no sea un caso aislado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Lo dudo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh. Mira eso. Resina.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y donde hay resina, deber haber un fabricador de la Alianza cerca.<sb>Ve si lo encuentras, es posible que podamos actualizar tu armamento.
eventualmente me voy a quedar SIN munición.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, mantente alerta.<sb>Al parecer hay muertos por todos lados. Y pues... no es que quiera ser grosero, pero ya no necesitas sus municiones.
<clr:255,190,255>Ja, creo que puedo redirigir esto con mi multiherramienta.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Tu qué?
<clr:255,190,255>Es una herramienta con diferentes funciones.<sb>Así que, ya sabes: multiherramienta.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, ¡esa cosa es increíble!<sb>¡Necesitas un nombre que también sea increíble!<sb>¡Algo que se venda!
<clr:255,190,255>¿A quién se la voy a vender?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, la Alianza no estará aquí para siempre.<sb>¡Alyx, debes pensar en el futuro!
<clr:255,190,255>Bueno, ¿qué te parece si la llamo "La Alyx"?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pues, supongo. Es un poco derivativo de los "Russell" pero sí
<sb>Provisionalmente, la "Alyx" funciona.
<clr:255,190,255>Sí, "La Alyx".
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Bien hecho!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Mira, una estación de curación!
<clr:255,190,255>Russell, la <I>Alianza<I> las usa.<sb>¿Crees que sean seguras?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Gracias al cielo, ahí hay una estación de curación.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Claro, yo las uso todo el tiempo.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Estás seguro?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Así es, son geniales.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Solo mete tu mano ahí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Mira, sinceramente, solo tira de la palanca y mete tu mano ahí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Claro, yo las uso todo el tiempo. Solo encuentra una pila de energía.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Muy bien, amiga mía, estás lista.
<clr:255,190,255>¡Ay! Ay, ay, ay.
<clr:255,190,255>Ahhhh. Ey
<clr:255,190,255>Ahhh. Ooh.
<clr:255,190,255>Oye
tenías razón.<cr>Es genial.
<clr:255,190,255>Ahhh. Qué alivio.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cuidado con esa lapa, Alyx.
<clr:255,190,255>Son asquerosas.
<clr:255,190,255>Entonces, ¿cuándo comenzaste a llamar a los guantes de gravedad los "Russell"?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Es el nombre de la marca, Alyx.
<clr:255,190,255>¿La marca?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, necesitan un nombre que sea reconocible. Voy a hacer una fortuna con estas cosas después de que la Alianza se vaya y todo en la tierra vuelva a la normalidad.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Cómo conociste a papá?<sb>Trabajaron juntos en Black Mesa, ¿verdad?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí. Bueno, no.<sb>De hecho, es difícil conseguir un trabajo allí.<sb>Tuve una entrevista en Black Mesa.<sb>Me dijeron que lo intentara de nuevo el próximo año.<sb>No necesito contarte lo que sucedió después.<sb>La verdad fui muy afortunado.<sb>No hubo muchos sobrevivientes.<sb>Francamente, es un milagro que tú y tu padre salieran de ahí con vida.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Um, si necesitas un minuto porque vas a... <sb>Digo, puedo apagar la cámara
<clr:255,190,255>Solo estoy mirando, Russ.
<clr:255,190,255>Supongo que la zona de cuarentena está detrás de esta escotilla.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Así es, ahí es donde lo tienen.
<clr:255,190,255>Buscaré un panel de control para abrirla.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Si yo fuera parte de la Alianza, ¿dónde pondría el panel de control?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ese es el panel de control.<sb>Probablemente desarmaron los circuitos.<sb>Pero considerando que nadie sería tan estúpido como para abrir la escotilla, no creo que sea muy difícil de reparar.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Qué crees que sea esto?
<clr:255,190,255>Creo que
es una especie de cerradura.
<clr:255,190,255>¡Eso es!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ya está. Por fin.
<clr:255,190,255>Voy a entrar.<cr>¿A qué distancia está el Empalme Fairview?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tendrás que pasar por los viejos túneles del subterráneo para llegar al patio de trenes.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Ya empezaron a mover a papá?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No lo creo.<sb>Lo que son buenas noticias, porque todavía tenemos tiempo.
<clr:255,190,255>Oh, eso es genial.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>O malas noticias, porque ya lo mataron.<sb>Y no hay necesidad de mover un cadáver.<sb>Solo necesitas enterrarlo.<sb>O quemarlo.<sb>Alyx, ¿sigues ahí?
<clr:255,190,255>Ajá.
<clr:255,190,255>Sabes, Russell
Ahora que estoy entrando a la zona de cuarentena
Me doy cuenta.<sb> Que no sé nada <I>sobre<I> la zona de cuarentena.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, de hecho, la palabra cuarentena viene del italiano "quaranta giorni".<sb>Eh, lo que significa cuarenta días. Ese era el número de días que los marineros permanecían en aislamiento cuando sus barcos anclaban antes de dejarlos ir a tierra firme durante el tiempo de la Peste Negra.
<clr:255,190,255>Bien. Fantástico.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh, rayos.
<clr:255,190,255>Creo que nos quedamos encerrados aquí.
<clr:255,190,255>Oye, Russell.<sb>Acabo de encontrar una jeringa de Dios sabe qué.<sb>¿Sabes si es medicina?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Tiene una calavera y huesos cruzados?
<clr:255,190,255>No veo ninguno.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Entonces, probablemente es medicina.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! ¿Te inyectaste algo que encontraste en el suelo?
<clr:255,190,255>Me siento de MARAVILLA.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Sí? Okey. Muy bien. Pues
Experimento exitoso. Mantén los ojos abiertos por si encuentras más.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Escuchaste eso?
<clr:255,190,255>¿Qué es eso?
<clr:255,190,255>Oh, por Dios.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí. Por ahí
por ahí es que tienes que ir.
<clr:255,190,255>¿No hay un atajo?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, ese ES el atajo.
<clr:255,190,255>Entonces, tomemos el camino largo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, también es la ruta más larga.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien, eso parece que funcionó. Sigamos haciéndolo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138><sfx:1>[Risas]
<clr:255,190,255>Ah, caray.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Ja, ja!<cr>Esa lapa está de nuestro lado.<sb>Bueno, en realidad no, así que no pases por debajo de ellas.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Sabes? Los Russell tienen una pantalla integrada. Te muestran cuánta resina y munición tienes. Pensé que sería útil saberlo.
<clr:255,190,255>Entendido. Gracias.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, ten cuidado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! ¡Detrás de esa puerta!<sb>¡Creo que ahí hay un fabricador de la Alianza!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! Creo que ese es un fabricador de la Alianza.<sb>Pon algo adentro, quiero ver cómo funciona.
<clr:255,190,255>Entendido. ¿Funcionará con los Russell?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, pero debería arreglar bien esa pistola.<cr>Lo que es bueno, porque te di una de mis pistolas menos potentes.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, ya sabes... en caso de que no la vuelva a ver.
<clr:255,190,255>Sabes qué, Russell.<cr>Si muero, te debo una pistola.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Me debes una pistola de todos modos!<cr>No te la regalé. Es MI pistola.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, valió la pena usar la resina.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>La Alianza sabe cómo mejorar una pistola.<sb>Lo admito.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Se ve bastante mortífera.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Genial.<sb>Casi desearía estar ahí para probarlo yo mismo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Puedes darle un buen uso.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y ahora
eso te va a ayudar.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Buena elección.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Inteligente. Eso será útil.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Debería ayudar a tener la razón en algunas discusiones.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No me gustaría estar en el lado opuesto de eso.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora está actualizado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ya no puede hacerse más mortífera.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh, parece que eso funcionó, ¿verdad? Ja
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Guau! ¡Mi pistola se ve muy bien!
<clr:255,190,255>Vamos, Russ. A este punto, ya es "nuestra" pistola.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Guau, mira eso! Mi pistola mejora cada vez más.
<clr:255,190,255>Sabes, Russ... ¿Técnicamente? Es muy poco lo que QUEDA de tu pistola.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Umm. Pues, te diré algo. Vamos a dejar eso para otro momento. Podemos hablar sobre MI pistola cuando regreses.
<clr:255,190,255>Bueno, Russ, es oficial. Ya no queda NADA de tu pistola en esta. Esta es
esta es MI pistola.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Muy bien, me parece justo. Te la ganaste. Pero aún quiero que me devuelvas los Russell.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Cangrejo!
<clr:255,190,255>¡Lo veo!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Espera. ¿Dónde se metió?
<clr:255,190,255>¡Ah!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Ah!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, allí está. Lo encontraste.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Probablemente solo hay uno.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien, dos. Solo dos.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Qué buena puntería, Alyx.
<clr:255,190,255>Gracias. Muchas gracias, Russell.
<clr:255,190,255>Gracias. Sabes, después de tu sermón sobre cuán "menos potente" era esta arma, no creo que está tan mal.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, en realidad es bastante buena, ¿verdad?<cr>¡Rayos! Creo que te di la pistola equivocada.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Has oído algo sobre papá, Russell?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No. No se ha escuchado nada en la radio desde que lo subieron al tren.
<clr:255,190,255>Maldición.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno... la buena noticia es que probablemente esté bien.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Cómo lo SABES?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Porque lo están llevando a Nova Prospekt para torturarlo.<sb>Ese es el lugar donde torturan.<sb>Pero no tendrán mucho tiempo para torturarlo antes de que LLEGUEMOS.<sb>Así que, lógicamente, estará bien.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Ah!
<clr:255,190,255>¡Una estación de curación!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Ahh! ¡Mira, una estación de curación!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Umm. No está funcionando.
<clr:255,190,255>Ahh. Mira, aquí. Necesita energía.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Eso es un "disquete".<cr>Lo usábamos para guardar información. Funciona con magnetismo, si puedes creerlo.
<clr:255,190,255>Ja.

<clr:255,190,255>Russell. ¿Cómo sabes TODO esto?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Lo estoy leyendo en mi computadora.<cr>Descargué todo el internet antes de la guerra.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Descargaste todo el internet?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Eh, casi todo.
<clr:255,190,255>Estupendo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, así es.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell, ¿estás viendo esto?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ah, posiblemente.<sb>¿Estás viendo basura flotante?
<clr:255,190,255>Parece que
solo es cartón.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cierto. Al menos parece inofensivo.
<clr:255,190,255>Sí, pero no deja de ser raro.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Qué ES eso?
<clr:255,190,255>Parece una ilustración de vortigaunt
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Espera, ¿acaso es
Black Mesa?
<clr:255,190,255>Alguien invirtió mucho tiempo en esto.

<clr:255,190,255>¿Ustedes tenían todo eso? ¡Increíble!

<clr:255,190,255>Guau, Russ.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tanta presión que, de hecho, yo
<sb>Bueno, no sé si deba mencionarlo.<sb>Pero sí noté que si hubieras alcanzado la mano de tu padre, si él se hubiera agarrado, la presión hubiera destruido los delicados sensores de los Russell.
<clr:255,190,255>Ah. Okey.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Totalmente comprensible y, por cierto, hubiera valido la pena, en este caso.
<clr:255,190,255>Claro.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Dicho esto, me cuesta imaginarme OTRA situación en la que ese hubiera sido el caso.<sb>Y, uh, al igual que tu padre, los Russell NO tienen precio, así que
<sb>Solo
para que lo sepas, sabes, de ahora en adelante.
<clr:255,190,255>Russ, te lo prometo, tus guantes están a salvo conmigo.

<clr:255,190,255>Ah. Ahí está.
<clr:255,190,255>Oh, papá dijo que se robó algunos archivos sobre el arma.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, cuando se trata del cifrado de datos de la Alianza
<clr:255,190,255>¿Tú eres el que necesito...?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Eli es a quien necesitas!

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>De acuerdo, bien. Lo encontraste.<sb>Ahora ve a la ventana. Vamos.<sb>No puedo verlo a menos que lo hagas.
<clr:255,190,255>Santo cielo. Eso tiene que ser la bóveda.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí. Tu padre no mencionó que flotaba.
<clr:255,190,255>Así que, no solo hay que LLEGAR allí, también hay que SUBIR hasta ella.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Los cables! Mira todos los cables conectados a esa cosa.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Lo único que tenemos que hacer es seguirlos
<clr:255,190,255>Y romper lo que sea que está al otro extremo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y así se desplomará la bóveda.<sb>Simple. Fácil de seguir.<sb>Me gusta ese plan.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, tú... por una buena razón, estoy seguro... rechazaste mirar por la ventana.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Así que olvídate de la ventana. Del otro lado estaba la bóveda que tu padre quería que encontráramos.<sb>Está flotando en el aire, lo cual nos complica llegar a ella.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pero... está llena de cables.<sb>Supongo que si seguimos los cables y destruimos aquello a lo que están conectados, deberíamos poder derribar a la bóveda.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Voy a necesitar mirar por alguna ventana para derribar la bóveda?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, no lo creo.
<clr:255,190,255>Entonces, cuenta conmigo.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Has oído alguna comunicación de la Alianza sobre la fuga papá?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, nada. Todo trata sobre el envío de refuerzos a la zona de cuarentena.
<clr:255,190,255>Por el lado positivo, eso quiere decir que papá sigue en camino hacia ti.<sb>Nos habríamos enterado si hubieran capturado de nuevo a Eli Vance.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y por el lado negativo

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Eso hago. ¿Por qué lo dices así?
<clr:255,190,255>No, no... El vortigaunt dijo "Mira hacia la Estrella del Norte" para que ayude a sus amigos. Lo que sonaba como tonterías de vortigaunt, pero supongo que no lo es.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ah, sí. Eso tiene mucho más sentido.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ummm. Eso es una especie de subestación de la Alianza. En ellas se genera electricidad y se almacenan los protocolos de seguridad.
<clr:255,190,255>Como la energía y seguridad necesarias para una bóveda gigante.
<clr:255,190,255>Y
ahí está la bóveda.

Hola, soy Gabe Newell y les doy la bienvenida a <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Este producto fue más que un reto: es nuestro primer título de <I>Half-Life<I><sb>en más de diez años, y el primero de realidad virtual.<sb>Además de ser una gran experiencia de realidad virtual que mantuvo la<sb>esencia de ser un juego de <I>Half-Life<I>, queríamos que <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><sb>complaciera a los jugadores que han estado esperando saber qué ocurre<sb>luego del Episodio 2 y, además, que fuera una entrada para cualquiera que<sb>nunca haya jugado <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>En el fondo, ustedes decidirán si tuvimos éxito o no, pero esperamos que<sb>este modo comentado sirva para compartirles los problemas a los que nos<sb>enfrentamos en el desarrollo y cómo los resolvimos.<sb>Para escuchar un nodo de comentario, recoge el holograma flotante del<sb>radio frente a ti y colócalo sobre tu cabeza.<sb>Cuando hayas terminado de escuchar el comentario, puedes retirarte el<sb>radio o colocarte el siguiente.<sb>Me gustaría saber tu opinión.<sb>Escríbeme a: gaben@valvesoftware.com<sb>Aunque no puedo responder todos los correos que recibo, ten la certeza de<sb>que sí los leo todos y son una parte fundamental para evaluar nuestro<sb>trabajo.<sb>¡Gracias y diviértete!
Al igual que en las otras entregas de <I>Half-Life<I>, la primera hora de <I>Alyx<I><sb>debe transmitir mucha información al jugador, y esperamos que sea de una<sb>manera natural y entretenida.<sb>Los jugadores deben conocer quiénes son, en dónde están, en qué tipo de<sb>mundo se encuentran, quiénes son los otros personajes y facciones<sb>importantes, entre otros.<sb>Además, tienen que aprender a jugar.<sb>¿Cómo se mueven? ¿Con qué pueden interactuar y cómo? ¿Que deberían<sb>intentar?<sb>Saber con exactitud qué información transmitir en los primeros dos niveles<sb>y cómo hacerlo nos llevó casi dos años de pruebas.<sb>Es tentador querer incluir todo lo que pensamos que los jugadores deberían<sb>saber, pero siempre hay prioridades en el manejo de información. Mientras<sb>más información incluyéramos, mayor sería la probabilidad de que los<sb>jugadores pasaran por alto algo importante por distraerse con algo más.<sb>Así que en los dos niveles siguientes usaremos nodos de comentario para<sb>señalar algunos sitios en donde tuvimos problemas para transmitir<sb>información a los jugadores.<sb>Entre estos nodos, encontrarás muchos otros ejemplos que los jugadores<sb>podrán consultar si están interesados en saber más.
Una de las partes más importantes y difíciles de transmitir fue aclarar<sb>con precisión en qué momento se sitúa<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> en la cronología de<sb>la serie.<sb>Aunque tratamos de reflejarlo con cuidado en varios detalles del mundo,<sb>nunca quedaba del todo claro en<cr>las pruebas de juego.<sb>Con el tiempo, decidimos que era muy importante como para que los<sb>jugadores lo averiguaran por su cuenta, así que lo incluimos en la introducción.<sb>El estado incompleto de la Ciudadela sirvió como una oportunidad<sb>anticipada para reforzar la cronología<cr>de forma visual.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> ocurre cinco años antes de los sucesos de <I>Half-Life 2<I>, en<sb>donde la imponente Ciudadela es la sede del poder de la Alianza.<sb>No obstante, como vemos aquí, la infraestructura inicial de la Alianza es<sb>una maraña de cables y estructuras inusuales esparcidas por toda la ciudad<sb>que rodean la construcción de la Ciudadela, la cual funciona como<sb>indicador del momento temporal.<sb>Reforzamos esta imagen en otros lugares a lo largo del siguiente nivel.<sb>La arquitectura de la Alianza es abstracta tanto en su escala como en su<sb>forma, así que incluimos algunos clichés visuales de construcción humana:<sb>grandes andamios externos, algunas diferencias entre los pisos, hileras de<sb>lucecitas y el trazo de una silueta con elementos verticales<sb>estructurados, todo para tratar de crear un equilibrio entre retratar la<sb>naturaleza alienígena de la Ciudadela y hacer que su construcción<sb>resultara familiar para dejar claro su tamaño y estado.<sb>Grandes vistas panorámicas como esta son un desafío interesante en la<sb>realidad virtual.<sb>La distancia a la que se encuentran del jugador quiere decir que no se<sb>benefician de la visión estereoscópica de la misma forma en que lo hacen<sb>los objetos vistos desde cerca.<sb>Por ello, los objetos pequeños del balcón suelen llamar la atención de los<sb>jugadores antes de que hayan podido ver la estructura imponente que se<sb>alza a la distancia.<sb>Si hubiéramos colocado la Ciudadela demasiado cerca, se sentiría como una<sb>construcción absurdamente enorme y difícil de asimilar.<sb>No obstante, al estar ubicada sola, en el horizonte, aparentaba ser<sb>bidimensional y plana.<sb>Encontramos la solución para llenar el espacio entre el espectador y la<sb>estructura distante con varias referencias de escala.<sb>La misma ciudad, inmensos cables de alimentación que se dirigen al punto<sb>de fuga, grandes construcciones repetidas de la Alianza, la espesa niebla<sb>de la contaminación, la iluminación cuidadosa y todos los elementos<sb>animados, sobre todo el helicóptero, cuyo sonido aparece con la imagen.<sb>Compusimos todos estos elementos de forma cuidadosa para atraer la<sb>atención de los jugadores primero hacia la Ciudadela, antes de que se<sb>dispersen con los detalles de la ciudad y<sb>se queden en los objetos tentadores del balcón.
En las primeras áreas del juego, nos costó mostrar la densidad y tener la<sb>priorización de la información que queríamos comunicarles a los jugadores.<sb>Las pruebas de juego nos mostraron que los jugadores de realidad virtual<sb>se distraen con facilidad, muchas veces a causa de una visión periférica<sb>mejorada que hace que se concentren en un elemento de la escena y pierdan<sb>de vista los demás.<sb>Esto se exacerbaba en las primeras habitaciones, porque los jugadores<sb>todavía se estaban aclimatando a la realidad virtual por primera vez en<sb>muchos casos.<sb>Además, los jugadores progresan a distintos ritmos.<sb>Observamos que algunos a jugadores pasaban 30 segundos en el balcón del<sb>inicio, mientras que otros, 30 minutos.<sb>Por ello, realizamos muchos cambios en este conjunto de áreas de apertura,<sb>como en la información que queríamos comunicar y dónde.<sb>Originalmente, la videollamada de Eli ocurría después, en el refugio, con<sb>el snark y la cámara, pero los jugadores se concentraban demasiado en las<sb>interacciones con todos los detalles del cuarto como para prestar atención<sb>a la conversación entre Eli y Russell.<sb>Trasladamos la videollamada al balcón del inicio, pero era un elemento<sb>distractor con respecto al plano general de Ciudad 17 y la Ciudadela.<sb>Además, ocurría en un momento en el que los jugadores aún estaban<sb>asimilando los elementos básicos del juego, como el movimiento y la<sb>interacción manual con el mundo.<sb>Esa superposición complicaba lo simple, como cuándo enseñarle al jugador<sb>una ventana emergente sobre movimiento si la videollamada<cr>comenzaba enseguida.<sb>Al final, optamos por insertar el invernadero entre el balcón del inicio y<sb>el refugio, lo que nos permitió trasladar la videollamada a un área un<sb>poco más oscura y con menos objetos con los que interactuar.<sb>Así evitamos los problemas de distracción y nos aseguramos de que los<sb>jugadores ya hubieran pasado la fase inicial de juego dedicada a<sb>comprender la configuración de hardware y movimiento.<sb>Además, nos permitió agregar mayor detalle al balcón del inicio y al<sb>refugio de Alyx, sin temor a crear distracciones que<sb>afectaran la videollamada.
Más allá de dar información fundamental sobre el estado del mundo, los dos<sb>primeros niveles de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> también debían reflejar las ventajas<sb>de la realidad virtual.<sb>La realidad virtual comunica un mejor sentido de escala que las pantallas<sb>planas, y nuestras pruebas iniciales nos demostraron que nada hacía tan<sb>atractiva la escala como ver a un zancudo de cerca.<sb>Además de los elementos gráficos, para ilustrar la escala de un zancudo a<sb>una distancia corta necesitábamos trabajar de manera puntual en su sonido.<sb>Los jugadores tenían muchas expectativas sobre el peso, el poder y la<sb>presencia del zancudo a través de sus movimientos, sobre todo cuando se<sb>posa sobre el balcón en el que está el jugador.<sb>Para transmitir este poder a través del sonido, superpusimos varios<sb>efectos sonoros que nos permitieron abordar rangos en el espectro de la<sb>frecuencia auditiva y la naturaleza temporal de esos elementos por<sb>separado.<sb><wait:5>Luego, combinamos esos elementos en el motor de audio de Source 2 para<sb>controlarlos como un solo sonido.
En esta habitación, a la cual nos referimos internamente como el refugio<sb>de Alyx, fue el sitio inicial en donde sucedía la videollamada con Eli.<sb>No obstante, después de cambiar la videollamada al balcón, esta habitación<sb>quedó libre para resolver otros problemas.<sb>En la serie de <I>Half-Life<I>, siempre hemos tratado de asegurarnos de incluir<sb>mucha narrativa para que todos los jugadores puedan entender<cr>adónde van y por qué,<sb>pero aquellos que avanzan más lento y prestan atención,<sb>encuentran detalles que los ayudan a entender mejor lo que ocurre.<sb>Con el balcón como el sitio para familiarizarse con las características<sb>del juego, el invernadero como el lugar en el que inicia la historia y el<sb>zancudo para sorprender a los espectadores, decidimos<cr>que el refugio sería<sb>un espacio en donde los jugadores pudieran tener un momento tranquilo y<sb>descubrir más detalles de la narrativa en el entorno.<sb>Al mismo tiempo, podía ser un lugar para explorar un poco más, luego de<sb>haberse familiarizado con la realidad virtual.<sb>El tiempo en el refugio sirve para que los jugadores ocupen el papel de<sb>Alyx en la resistencia y<cr>su lugar en el mundo.<sb>Queríamos que se sintiera como un verdadero búnker, en donde Alyx había<sb>estado encerrada por semanas o meses mientras planeaba el ataque y<sb>analizaba a la Alianza.<sb>La cámara, el snark y las pizarras blancas son objetos con los que se<sb>puede interactuar de manera detallada y sirven de recompensa por una<sb>investigación más profunda al darles a los jugadores curiosos más<sb>información sobre el mundo de la Ciudad 17 y lo que Alyx ha estado<sb>haciendo allí.
Dos elementos cruciales de información que necesitábamos que los jugadores<sb>comprendieran eran fáciles de enunciar, pero difíciles de comunicar: que<sb>los jugadores jugaban como Alyx Vance, y no como Gordon Freeman, con quien<sb>habían jugado en las entregas anteriores<cr>de <I>Half-Life<I>, y que, esta vez,<sb>Alyx hablaría, a diferencia de Gordon.<sb>Es probable que esto parezca obvio ahora, pero antes de trabajarlo, no<sb>resultaban evidentes para los jugadores de prueba.<sb>No queríamos que quedara ninguna duda de que los jugadores estarían<sb>jugando como Alyx, así que llamamos el producto con su nombre.<sb>Pero, incluso así, fuimos muy cuidadosos para que<cr>este hecho se reforzara<sb>de inmediato en la videollamada con Eli.<sb>Añadimos a Olga, el personaje que se presenta aquí, para hacerlo más obvio<sb>al llamar cuando el jugador sale del elevador.<sb>Olga es el primer personaje al que el jugador conoce en persona y su<sb>diálogo aquí, así como el del callejón, sirve para aclarar que está<sb>conversando con el jugador y que la voz femenina que el jugador escucha es<sb>Alyx respondiéndole.<sb>Dar a entender esto fue más difícil en la videollamada con Eli, porque ahí<sb>ya se incluye el diálogo fuera de pantalla de Russell, mientras que en<sb>esta escena queda claro que nadie más participa en esta conversación salvo<sb>Olga y el jugador.<sb>Sin Olga, nos dimos cuenta de que, a pesar de que ya habían hablado con<sb>Eli y Russell en la videollamada, los jugadores de prueba<sb>no sentían que fueran Alyx.
Cuando iniciamos <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, nos daba curiosidad saber qué impacto<sb>tendría la realidad virtual en el diseño musical.<sb>La serie de <I>Half-Life<I> siempre ha usado la música de forma moderada<sb>permitiendo que los sonidos del mundo sean el sonido de ambiente.<sb>Pero es una herramienta que nos gusta usar para resaltar momentos en los<sb>que el estado del mundo cambia de manera notoria; en este caso, que algo<sb>conmocionó a la Alianza.<sb>En las pruebas iniciales de esta escena en las que no había música, pero<sb>sí otros elementos gráficos y sonoros, nos percatamos de que algunos<sb>jugadores no entendían muy bien que debían avanzar, mientras que otros se<sb>distrajeron con los objetos interactivos de la lavandería.<sb>Experimentamos con música de "acción" muy sencilla para comunicar el<sb>cambio en el nivel de amenaza de la Alianza, así como la intención de la<sb>historia de que Alyx se pusiera a salvo. Con la música, vimos que era<sb>menos probable que los jugadores olvidaran su misión y avanzaran hacia la<sb>meta.<sb>La música era simple y "cinematográfica" para permitir que se mezclara con<sb>los sonidos de fondo intencionalmente complementarios y normalizar poco a<sb>poco su presencia en la realidad virtual de manera familiar.<sb>Este acierto nos motivó a usar la misma técnica en las escenas con<sb>requisitos similares a lo largo del juego.
El resto de este nivel está diseñado para informar al jugador sobre el<sb>mundo en el que está y para reforzar el hecho de que la Alianza estaba<sb>cada vez más alerta.<sb>Queríamos que los detalles transmitieran una sensación de vida a la<sb>ciudad, algo que se vuelve mucho más complejo más adelante, cuando el<sb>jugador ya tiene un arma.<sb>Fue complicado diseñarlo debido al desafío que enfrentamos habitualmente:<sb>la fricción entre la narrativa<cr>y la jugabilidad.<sb>Aquí, la narrativa dice que Alyx debe dirigirse con sigilo hacia donde<sb>está Eli tan pronto como sea posible.<sb>Pero en términos de jugabilidad, estamos al inicio y los jugadores aún<sb>están probando los límites de lo que pueden ver y tocar.<sb>Como era de esperarse, las pruebas mostraron que algunos jugadores se<sb>volcaban de lleno a la historia y avanzaban de inmediato por el área,<sb>mientras que otros ignoraban por completo la historia y exploraban todos<sb>los rincones.<sb>Aunque era atractiva la idea de eliminar todas las tentaciones para que<sb>todos los jugadores se apegaran a la historia, enviaría el mensaje<sb>equivocado sobre la complejidad del mundo y las recompensas del juego para<sb>los jugadores que lo exploran.<sb>Pasamos meses afinando esta sección: añadimos, modificamos y eliminamos<sb>algunos elementos.<sb>Tratamos de hallar el nivel adecuado de tensión narrativa, con el que los<sb>jugadores sintieran que estaban avanzando, pero a un ritmo que les<sb>permitiera detenerse a juguetear<cr>con algo.<sb>Agregamos muchos objetos interactivos y momentos narrativos en los que los<sb>jugadores siempre eran recompensados por su curiosidad, pero también<sb>pautamos que esas distracciones<cr>fueran breves para motivarlos<sb>a seguir avanzando.
Para evitar cualquier indicio de mareo<cr>provocado por el movimiento de un<sb>jugador a bordo de un vehículo, en<cr>esta escena inicialmente Alyx se<sb>despertaba después del choque de la camioneta.<sb>Sin embargo, esta decisión fue recibida<cr>con decepción por parte de los<sb>jugadores, ya que les parecía que el<cr>juego los privaba de experimentar un<sb>momento emocionante.<sb>Atender sus sugerencias implicaba abordar<cr>el problema técnico para que los<sb>jugadores pudieran moverse de manera<cr>cómoda en un vehículo.<sb>En esta camioneta y en el tren al final<cr>del mapa es posible observar que<sb>el mundo exterior solo puede verse<cr>desde ventanas pequeñas.<sb>Estas vistas externas son necesarias<cr>para crear la sensación de<sb>movimiento, pero el tamaño reducido<cr>de las ventanas sirve para que el<sb>campo de visión del jugador siempre<cr>esté dominado por el interior del<sb>vehículo, que está en su marco<cr>de referencia natural.<sb>Este diseño reduce bastante la sensación de mareo.<sb>Además de la relación con el exterior, <cr>usamos iluminación animada y un diseño<sb>de sonido minucioso para producir<cr>el efecto de estar viajando en un vehículo.
Mientras que el mapa anterior se concentraba<cr>en transmitirle al jugador<sb>mucha información sobre el estado<cr>del mundo, en este mapa comienza su<sb>misión más grande.<sb>Eso quiere decir que el jugador tendrá<cr>que salir de este mapa sabiendo qué<sb>fue lo que le sucedió a Eli y<cr>lo que hará al respecto.<sb>El jugador también tiene que conocer<cr>a Russell, para ponerle un rostro a<sb>la voz de las conversaciones de radio<cr>presentes a lo largo del juego.<sb>Por último, el jugador deberá recolectar<cr>los guantes de gravedad<sb>y la pistola, y aprender a usarlos.<sb>Son muchas tareas.<sb>Por experiencia, sabemos que, si saturamos<cr>de información a los jugadores<sb>en una sola escena, solo podrán<cr>recordar parte de ella.<sb>El propósito de este mapa es darle un ritmo<cr>a la narrativa: tenemos que<sb>separar los eventos cruciales y<cr>comunicarlos con suficiente distancia y<sb>tiempo entre sí para que los jugadores<cr>puedan asimilarlos y recordarlos.<sb>Además, estamos un poco bajo presión.<sb>La prueba de juego mostró que, a esta altura,<cr>algunos jugadores ya llevan jugando<sb>casi 30 minutos y se preguntan cuándo aparecerán los enemigos.
Uno de los primeros pasos que tomó<cr>el equipo de escritores en este mapa<sb>fue darle más sustancia a una escena<cr>entre Russell y Alyx para que<sb>abarcara todo el diálogo necesario.<sb>Debido a que el jugador se encuentra<cr>con Russell por primera vez, y que<sb>hay un gran número de eventos dentro<cr>de la historia sobre los que Alyx y<sb>Russell tienen que hablar, el diálogo de<cr>la escena terminó siendo abrumador.<sb>Sabíamos que no podíamos construir<cr>una escena tan larga sin aburrir a los<sb>jugadores, y los elementos más importantes pasarían desapercibidos.<sb>Una de las primeras herramientas que<cr>usamos para abordar este asunto fue<sb>la introducción del dron de Russell.<sb>Pudimos reducir el diálogo de la escena<cr>original y transmitirlo en el área<sb>que antecede a esa escena.<sb>De ese modo, se pudo omitir el<cr>contexto preliminar de la historia y<sb>centrarse en el objetivo principal del diálogo.
Además de ajustar el ritmo de la historia<cr>para que fuera comprensible,<sb>este mapa tenía que seguir comunicando el<cr>estado del mundo que está afuera<sb>de la zona de cuarentena.<sb>También, queríamos que los jugadores<cr>supieran cuándo ocurre<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> en la cronología de<cr><I>Half-Life<I> y atestiguaran el inmenso<sb>tamaño de la Ciudadela en construcción.<sb>El poder de la Alianza se ve representado en su<cr>indiferencia hacia la humanidad.<sb>Conquistaron la Tierra sin mayor esfuerzo y<cr>ahora la están saqueando para<sb>sus propios fines.<sb>Aunque hicieron por lo menos el mínimo<cr>esfuerzo en su propaganda, la<sb>verdad es que no les importa.<sb>Luego, en <I>Half-Life 2<I>, vemos los intentos<cr>de Breen por comunicarse con la<sb>humanidad con mayor seriedad, pero no<cr>queda claro si esa instrucción<sb>proviene de la Alianza o si es el intento<cr>de Breen de serles de utilidad.<sb>Mientras tanto, la construcción de la Alianza<cr>es despiadadamente eficiente.<sb>Los invasivos cables de alimentación<cr>de la Ciudadela no tienen ninguna<sb>intención de ajustarse a las vidas de<cr>los habitantes, mientras la Alianza<sb>drena a la ciudad de su energía.<sb>En este patio de juegos, un nodo nostálgico<cr>de <I>Half-Life 2<I>, este cable<sb>gigantesco atraviesa el mural de la pared demostrando el desinterés total<sb>de la Alianza por la historia de la ciudad.
En el laboratorio de Russell, el jugador<cr>se encuentra por primera vez en<sb>el mismo espacio que otro personaje y<cr>resalta uno de los mayores desafíos<sb>que enfrentamos al diseñar escenas<cr>coreografiadas en realidad virtual:<sb>mantener al jugador y a los personajes<cr>en sus espacios asignados.<sb>En los títulos anteriores de <I>Half-Life<I>,<cr>limitábamos los movimientos del<sb>jugador si <I>queríamos<I> que no se<cr>interpusieran en el camino.<sb>Hicimos varias pruebas para encontrar<cr>una solución similar en realidad<sb>virtual, pero los jugadores se sintieron<cr>muy incómodos o desorientados.<sb>En vez de eso, diseñamos los espacios<cr>de tal forma que existiera una<sb>separación natural entre el jugador y los personajes.<sb>Cuando no pudimos implementar esos<cr>separadores naturales, restringimos el<sb>movimiento de los jugadores para que<cr>no pudieran invadir el espacio de los<sb>personajes, quitando esa restricción<cr>tan pronto como el personaje se apartara.<sb>Otro reto fue equilibrar las respuestas<cr>de los personajes ante las<sb>acciones del jugador mientras le comunicaban<cr>un mensaje importante de la historia.<sb>En las primeras pruebas, dejamos que los personajes pausaran sus oraciones<sb>para responder de inmediato al jugador<cr>y luego continuar con su diálogo.<sb>Aunque era muy sencillo desde el costado<cr>técnico, fue muy difícil ejecutar<sb>la animación y el diálogo al mismo tiempo<cr>sin que se sintiera forzado.<sb>La combinación de reacciones personalizadas necesarias para abarcar el<sb>rango de las posibles interacciones de los jugadores, así como el momento<sb>en el que retomaban el diálogo, se<cr>salió de control muy rápido.<sb>Con el tiempo, encontramos una solución que permitía un mínimo de<sb>interacciones durante la transmisión<cr>de información importante, así como<sb>un rango más amplio de respuestas para las reacciones más complejas<sb>después de que la escena hubiera terminado.<sb>En el caso de Russell, combinamos un sutil movimiento de inclinación de<sb>cabeza y contacto visual natural<cr>mientras habla con Alyx.<sb>Luego de la escena en la que está<cr>escribiendo en su computadora,<sb>reaccionará cuando los jugadores traten de tocarlo o le arrojen objetos.
Desde los primeros experimentos con<cr>realidad virtual, comprendimos que los<sb>jugadores esperan un nivel alto de<cr>fidelidad sonora, incluso en las<sb>interacciones más cortas, sobre todo con<cr>los sonidos que se relacionan con<sb>los gráficos que pueden ver.<sb>Por ejemplo, en uno de los títulos anteriores,<cr>era aceptable usar una secuencia<sb>genérica de sonidos de teclas cuando<cr>Russell estaba escribiendo.<sb>No obstante, en realidad virtual, sabemos<cr>que un jugador puede ver las<sb>animaciones de cerca e incluso<cr>poner su cabeza a la altura<sb>del teclado de Russell.<sb>En esos casos, los jugadores se darían <cr>cuenta de que la animación y<sb>el sonido de la escritura en computadora<cr>no son equivalentes.<sb>Para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, creamos una serie<cr>de sonidos individuales de cada<sb>tecla que se activan siguiendo a la animación.<sb>Por ejemplo...<sb><wait:2>Cuando los dedos de Russell presionan<cr>una tecla, se reproduce uno de los<sb>sonidos correspondientes a las teclas<cr>y se genera una sincronización<sb>precisa entre la animación y el sonido.
Una frustración recurrente entre jugadores<cr>de realidad virtual ocurre<sb>cuando deben agacharse o estirarse para<cr>alcanzar objetos en el mundo virtual,<sb>sobre todo si su espacio en<cr>el mundo real es limitado.<sb>Una solución común es acercarles los objetos,<cr>en vez de que los jugadores<sb>tengan que ir por ellos.<sb>Sabíamos que esta característica sería<cr>importante en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> con<sb>sus niveles en expansión y el deseo de los jugadores por explorar cada<sb>rincón del mundo.<sb>No queríamos que esta mecánica se<cr>sintiera forzada o mágica, así que<sb>decidimos integrarla a la ficción del juego<cr>con los guantes de gravedad,<sb>precursores naturales de la pistola<cr>antigravedad de <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Así, pudimos presentar la mecánica como una acción física real facilitada<sb>por un artefacto tecnológico que<cr>es parte de la ficción.<sb>Para enfatizar el carácter físico único<cr>de la realidad virtual, usamos<sb>un gesto físico para activar el tirón, en vez<cr>de un botón para presionar, y<sb>luego instamos al jugador a atrapar el objeto,<cr>en vez de que este fuera<sb>directamente a su mano.<sb>Este ajuste hizo que la mecánica se<cr>sintiera más natural y anclada<sb>al universo ficticio del juego, que permitió a los jugadores sentirse fuertes.
Cuando el jugador tira de un objeto con<cr>los guantes de gravedad, usamos el<sb>motor de física del juego para implementar<cr>a ese objeto una fuerza de<sb>lanzamiento con una trayectoria parcialmente influida por la dirección del<sb>gesto de tirón del jugador.<sb>Ajustamos la velocidad de lanzamiento<cr>del objeto para que iguale el tiempo<sb>común del vuelo entre tirar y atrapar,<cr>y así el jugador desarrolle un<sb>ritmo que se vuelva automático con el tiempo.<sb>Queremos que el objeto llegue a la mano de la manera más natural posible,<sb>por lo que luego del lanzamiento inicial aplicamos de modo continuo un<sb>pequeño impulso a lo largo de la trayectoria<sb>(representado por las flechas blancas).<sb>Esos impulsos ayudan a contrarrestar<cr>la gravedad y a compensar las<sb>colisiones con obstáculos en el camino, mientras que continuamente dirigen<sb>el objeto hacia la mano, que es en sí misma un objetivo en movimiento.<sb>Un generoso alcance de captura y una sutil interacción háptica cuando el<sb>objeto entra en ese alcance garantiza virtualmente que terminará en la<sb>mano del jugador cada vez,<cr>incluso si su atención está<sb>enfocada en otra parte.<sb>Otro de los beneficios de implementar la mecánica con la física es que no<sb>tuvimos que recalibrar el tamaño, peso<cr>o inercia de cada objeto, ya que se<sb>compensaba automáticamente con<cr>la gravedad atípica con la que<sb>los jugadores se encuentran dentro de<cr>la bóveda al final del juego.
Hasta en nuestros primeros intentos por llevar<cr><I>Half-Life<I> a la realidad<sb>virtual, descubrimos que a los jugadores les gusta explorar cada rincón<sb>del entorno.<sb>Con la fidelidad aumentada de la realidad virtual, los jugadores no solo<sb>esperan poder interactuar con una amplia gama de objetos, sino que también<sb>tienen un gran deseo de encontrar algo útil de vez en cuando.<sb>Esto era tan universal entre los jugadores de prueba que, además de nuevos<sb>lugares para buscar y objetos interactivos, añadimos un nuevo recurso:<sb>la resina.<sb>Los diseñadores de nivel pueden colocar este nuevo recurso en lugares<sb>divertidos e interesantes que no se vinculen al progreso del juego, lo que<sb>recompensa la exploración minuciosa de los jugadores.<sb>También vinculamos este nuevo recurso a una meta a mayor plazo en forma de<sb>mejoras de arma, lo cual motivará aún más a los jugadores<sb>a explorar su entorno.<sb>Las exploraciones profundas de los buscatesoros y la observación<sb>entusiasta otorgarán más resina como recompensa.
Internamente, nos referimos a este tipo de acertijos como una conexión de<sb>la corriente eléctrica, debido a su parecido con los detectores de cables<sb>de la vida real, usados para localizar instalaciones<sb>eléctricas en la pared.<sb>La mecánica de la conexión se concibió como una herramienta para que los<sb>diseñadores desarrollaran experiencias de juego que involucraran el uso de<sb>manos y cabeza del jugador.<sb>El diseño inicial solo requería que el jugador usara su multiherramienta<sb>para empujar una bola de energía por un camino, parecido a un laberinto de<sb>cuentas de juguete para niños.<sb>Aunque este diseño simple tuvo éxito al lograr que el jugador colocara<sb>su cabeza y manos en sitios específicos, la falta de ramificaciones le<sb>impedía tomar decisiones y tampoco había ninguna consecuencia negativa.<sb>Para abordar estos problemas, añadimos elementos de cruce giratorios<sb>a través de los cuales se ramificaron caminos y se convirtieron en el medio<sb>principal para que el jugador interactuara con los acertijos de conexión<sb>de la corriente eléctrica. Aunque la complejidad de estos acertijos<sb>aumenta a lo largo del juego, el primero está diseñado para usar elementos<sb>mínimos para presentarles a los jugadores a las ideas centrales de que la<sb>energía viaja a través de los cables puede redirigirse mediante los cruces<sb>giratorios e incide en el mundo físico al encender las luces y abrir puertas.<sb>La chispeante toma de corriente eléctrica que desciende al suelo no es<sb>estrictamente necesaria para este acertijo, pero la añadimos para que los<sb>jugadores se familiaricen con su comportamiento, ya que causaba confusión<sb>en los acertijos posteriores cuando se encontraban con ella por primera<sb>vez en configuraciones más complejas.
Desde nuestros primeros experimentos en realidad virtual, nos dimos cuenta<sb>de lo importante que era la iluminación de alta calidad y densidad para<sb>transmitir una sensación de realismo.<sb>En el desarrollo de juegos, cualquier elección tecnológica implica<sb>compensaciones entre la calidad, el rendimiento en tiempo de ejecución y<sb>el tiempo de desarrollo.<sb>Para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, elegimos una solución de mapeo de luz de alta<sb>calidad y alto rendimiento que requirió una gran cantidad de<sb>preprocesamiento fuera de línea.<sb>Realizamos el preprocesamiento de mapas de luz usando una granja de<sb>renderizado, que podría tomar varias horas para un solo mapa con la más<sb>alta calidad, y nos esforzamos mucho en mitigar el costo de ese alto<sb>tiempo de iteración para los diseñadores del equipo.<sb>Específicamente, implementamos una aproximación en tiempo real al<sb>resultado final de iluminación que permitió a los diseñadores iluminar<sb>escenas en tiempo real con la confianza de que los mapas de luz de alto<sb>rendimiento coincidirían con su intención. La mayoría de las luces en<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> se unen en un solo término que describe la distancia de<sb>caída y sombreado, lo que nos permite cambiar el brillo y el color de las<sb>luces en tiempo real sin costo.<sb>Esta codificación también nos permite aplicar sombras de accesorios y<sb>caracteres dinámicos sin tener que representar ninguna geometría estática<sb>en mapas de sombras.<sb>Nuestros mapas de luz almacenan información direccional utilizando la<sb>popular codificación Ambient Highlight Direction, una mejora sobre la<sb>propia técnica de mapeo normal Radiosity creada por Valve en <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Esta nueva codificación de mapa de luz garantiza que las superficies con<sb>baches parezcan accidentadas incluso cuando no están bajo luz directa.<sb>Esta fuente de luz parpadeante proporciona una buena ilustración de esta<sb>técnica, ya que se puede percibir el detalle de la superficie incluso<sb>durante los momentos en que la fuente de luz está apagada.
Las lapas, aunque son una emblemática criatura de <I>Half-Life<I>, presentaron<sb>algunos desafíos interesantes específicos en la realidad virtual.<sb>Aunque que su lengua está destinada a atrapar a jugadores apresurados o<sb>desprevenidos, aquellos atrapados por ellos a menudo no se dieron cuenta<sb>de lo que estaba pasando.<sb>Se desorientaban y mareaban por el movimiento a medida que la lapa los<sb>levantaba para comerlos.<sb>De estos desafortunados jugadores, casi todos murieron en el juego y no<sb>pudieron aprender lo que estaba pasando, incluso después de múltiples<sb>encuentros.<sb>Para abordar este problema, recreamos la lengua como un sistema de<sb>partículas.<sb>Esto nos permitió tanto simularlo físicamente como posicionarlo de forma<sb>fiable para obtener la máxima visibilidad.<sb>Si un jugador es atrapado por una lapa, la lengua siempre se envuelve<sb>frente a su cara sin importar en qué dirección intente mirar.<sb>Esto hace que la lengua sea casi imposible de perder y guía visualmente<sb>los ojos del jugador hasta la ubicación de la lapa para que sepan dónde<sb>disparar para liberarse.<sb>Los elementos visuales de asfixia que se activan a medida que el jugador<sb>se levanta no solo sirven para comunicar el daño que el jugador está<sb>sufriendo, sino que también ayudan a reducir el mareo por el movimiento al<sb>reducir el campo visual del jugador.<sb>Estos cambios, combinados con efectos de sonido y otros efectos visuales<sb>como ver estrellas y desmayarse, eliminan la confusión para los jugadores<sb>y nos permitieron traer a este enemigo clásico al mundo de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.
Recibimos muchos comentarios positivos de nuestros experimentos iniciales<sb>que requieren que los jugadores realicen una serie de acciones físicas<sb>para recargar la pistola.<sb>Específicamente: expulsar el cartucho, recuperar un nuevo cartucho de la<sb>mochila, insertarlo en la pistola y cargar una ronda.<sb>Los jugadores disfrutaron aprendiendo y mejorando con esta habilidad.<sb>Experimentamos con el uso de un solo botón tanto para expulsar un cartucho<sb>como para cargar una ronda, pero descubrimos que asignar estas operaciones<sb>a dos botones diferentes era más interesante a pesar de que era más<sb>agotador mentalmente.<sb>De hecho, era más interesante precisamente porque era más agotador, ya que<sb>los jugadores frecuentemente mezclaban los botones bajo presión.<sb>En las primeras etapas del juego, los jugadores estaban buscando<sb>cartuchos, los expulsaban cuando querían cargar una ronda y generalmente<sb>pasaba un desastre.<sb>Para nosotros que observamos la prueba de juego, esto parecía que todo<sb>había salido terriblemente mal, pero los jugadores mismos citaron<sb>consistentemente esto como un punto divertido de sus sesiones de juego.<sb>Debido a la naturaleza física de la recarga y la habilidad requerida, los<sb>jugadores se culparon a sí mismos y no al juego por los errores cometidos<sb>mientras aprendían la secuencia de recarga.<sb>En esta área, proporcionamos una serie de objetivos estáticos en forma de<sb>lapas para que los jugadores disparen a su propio ritmo, lo que aumentaba<sb>la probabilidad de que tengan al menos algunas recargas antes de continuar.
En juegos anteriores de <I>Half-Life<I>, mientras juegas como Gordon, los<sb>jugadores veían a Alyx usar su multiherramienta para hackear los sistemas<sb>de seguridad de la Alianza con el fin de desbloquear puertas o realizar<sb>otros actos de sabotaje.<sb>Esto nos brindó la oportunidad de representar las habilidades de hackeo de<sb>Alyx a través de minijuegos centrados en la realidad virtual.<sb>Todos nuestros diseños de minijuegos de hacking se hicieron para<sb>aprovechar la cabeza y las manos de forma independiente comunes en los<sb>sistemas de realidad virtual de hoy en día.<sb>Queríamos animar a los jugadores a usar ambas manos simultáneamente y<sb>mover la cabeza para crear paralaje, para que entendieran las relaciones<sb>espaciales dentro de los acertijos.<sb>Estos acertijos de hackeo de casilleros se basan en uno de nuestros<sb>primeros prototipos, en el que el jugador tenía la tarea de usar una<sb>herramienta en una mano para pintar un camino en una esfera sostenida por<sb>la otra.<sb>Había algo divertido y único en usar todos los grados naturales de<sb>libertad de ambas manos para resolver un acertijo en realidad virtual.<sb>En su forma más simple, la solución de este acertijo es sencilla, pero la<sb>dificultad aumenta gradualmente a lo largo del juego al introducir<sb>obstáculos estáticos o móviles de varias formas y tamaños en la esfera.
En nuestros primeros prototipos, los jugadores podían curarse agarrando un<sb>paquete de vida en <I>Half-Life 2<I> y al presionar un botón del control, lo que<sb>obviamente no era una interacción muy interesante en realidad virtual.<sb>Durante el desarrollo de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, el equipo de Counter-Strike<sb>agregó jeringas de vida a CS:GO como parte del nuevo modo de juego de<sb>Danger Zone que estaban desarrollando.<sb>Cuando vimos esto, sentimos que una jeringa también funcionaría como un<sb>elemento de curación intuitivo en la realidad virtual.<sb>Los jugadores presionan un botón para activar la jeringa como una forma de<sb>indicar su intención de usarlo.<sb>Esto evitó el uso involuntario de la jeringa y nos dio la oportunidad de<sb>mostrar lo física que iba a ser la interacción a través de hápticos,<sb>animación y sonido.<sb>Algunos jugadores de prueba incluso inicialmente respondieron con temor<sb>sobre el hecho de que iban a tener que usar una aguja en sí mismos y<sb>miraron hacia otro lado al realizar la acción de inyección.<sb>También tuvimos que crear aproximaciones de los brazos y el cuerpo del<sb>jugador, ya que todos los jugadores de prueba tenían sus propias<sb>preferencias sobre dónde querían aplicar la inyección.<sb>Incluso añadimos la capacidad de inyectarse en la cabeza, ya que muchos<sb>jugadores intentaron hacerlo solo para ver si funcionaría.
Teníamos que asegurarnos de que los jugadores se volvieran competentes en<sb>recargar su pistola durante los primeros niveles del juego o los<sb>encuentros posteriores serían demasiado difíciles.<sb>El mapa anterior solo contenía objetivos estáticos en forma de lapas.<sb>Los jugadores podían atacar a las lapas a su propio ritmo, pero había<sb>suficientes como para que los jugadores tuvieran que recargar al menos<sb>unas cuantas veces.<sb>Este primer zombi vivo está bloqueado detrás de la cerca y no puede llegar<sb>al jugador hasta que este opte por el encuentro al disparar a la cerradura<sb>de la puerta.<sb>La colocación de zombis en la próxima sección del juego está diseñada para<sb>requerir mucha recarga, para garantizar que<sb>el jugador desarrolle esta habilidad.
La realidad virtual ofrece la oportunidad de añadir física al juego, pero<sb>esto debe equilibrarse con la fatiga y accesibilidad del jugador.<sb>Por ejemplo, experimentamos con un techo bajo en esta área, lo que<sb>requería que los jugadores se agacharan todo el tiempo que se abrieran<sb>camino a través de la parte superior de estos vagones de tren.<sb>A los jugadores de prueba no les gustó tener que agacharse tanto tiempo,<sb>así que levantamos el techo.
Los paneles de vidrio rompibles en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> son un sistema más<sb>diseñado para convencer a los jugadores de que están presentes en un mundo<sb>vivo.<sb>Los paneles detectan la posición de un impacto entrante y generan nuevos<sb>paneles de vidrio más pequeños en un patrón radial alrededor de la<sb>posición de impacto.<sb>Estos nuevos paneles pueden dividirse en paneles más pequeños, y así<sb>sucesivamente.<sb>Vimos que los jugadores a menudo rompían paneles de vidrio accidentalmente<sb>y luego pasaban tiempo "probando" lo interactivos que realmente eran al<sb>tratar de romperlos más, finalmente para darse cuenta de que, sí, el<sb>vidrio realmente se rompió en el lugar apropiado.<sb>En un momento dado, experimentamos con la construcción de acertijos<sb>especiales a partir de vidrio rompible, pero al final notamos que el<sb>vidrio era más apropiado como un elemento interactivo pasivo en el mundo,<sb>uno que reacciona de manera satisfactoria a una variedad de impactos,<sb>desde ataques cuerpo a cuerpo de zombis hasta disparos de armas o<sb>cualquier otra interacción física en el juego.
Las mejoras de armas son una nueva característica para la franquicia<sb><I>Half-Life<I> y, ficticiamente, esta mecánica se combina bien con la<sb>naturaleza de reparación de Alyx.<sb>Abordamos este desafío de diseño primero pensando en qué tipo de<sb>actualizaciones podrían ser importantes y también proporcionar un valor<sb>adicional a los jugadores sin eliminar las interacciones establecidas.<sb>Con una resina limitada para gastar, el sistema de actualización también<sb>proporcionó una vía para que los jugadores personalizaran e invirtieran en<sb>su arma favorita, o simplificaran una interacción en otra arma, lo que<sb>aumentaría su valor para ellos.<sb>Por ejemplo, la mira réflex todavía requiere que los jugadores apunten<sb>físicamente, pero mejora la interacción sobre exactamente dónde golpeará<sb>su tiro y expone puntos débiles enemigos previamente ocultos.<sb>Si bien algunos jugadores disfrutaron esta interacción y las nuevas<sb>oportunidades de puntería, otros no, y se centraron en mejoras que se<sb>adaptaron a <I>su<I> estilo de juego.<sb>Esto permitió a los jugadores gastar su resina limitada en las mejoras que<sb>más les importaban.<sb>Otro aspecto de las mejoras de armas en el que nos enfocamos no era<sb>necesariamente obvio cuando comenzamos a diseñar y probar combates en<sb>realidad virtual.<sb>Debido a la naturaleza más física del combate en realidad virtual, puede<sb>presionar la capacidad mental y física de ciertos jugadores, ya que<sb>requiere que usen ambas manos y mover la cabeza para comprender el entorno<sb>con los enemigos.<sb>Si bien esta es una experiencia muy natural, también está pasando mucho en<sb>cualquier momento con la recarga y el combate.<sb>A medida que observamos a los jugadores en algunas de estas situaciones de<sb>combate más intensas, comenzamos a encontrar oportunidades para permitir<sb>algunas mejoras para reducir el número de veces que se requería una<sb>interacción física o reducir la complejidad de una interacción en<sb>particular.<sb>El cargador automático de la escopeta es un buen ejemplo.<sb>Cuando se añade a la escopeta, la acción normalmente lenta y metódica de<sb>introducir proyectiles el arma se reemplaza con una interacción mucho más<sb>sencilla y rápida de meter los proyectiles en el cargador automático antes<sb>de que entren automáticamente en el arma.<sb>Esto permite a los jugadores mirar a su alrededor, concentrarse menos en<sb>el arma mientras se recarga y asimilar más de lo que está pasando.
Al inicio del proyecto <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, teníamos la expectativa de que los<sb>jugadores quisieran tomarse un descanso después de 30 a 45 minutos, ya que<sb>eso es lo que estábamos viendo con <I>The Lab<I> y otras experiencias de<sb>realidad virtual a menor escala disponibles en ese momento.<sb>Debido a esto, diseñamos el ritmo de los niveles del juego en torno a<sb>sesiones de juego de esa duración.<sb>Sin embargo, en el transcurso del desarrollo, el juego en sí incluyó más<sb>tiempo de inactividad entre encuentros de combate intensos y la comodidad<sb>de los nuevos cascos de realidad virtual mejoró considerablemente.<sb>De hecho, a medida que avanzaba el juego, descubrimos que los jugadores<sb>estaban felices de jugar durante horas y horas.<sb>Al final de las pruebas de juego, los jugadores a menudo comentaban que<sb>esto era lo más que habían jugado realidad virtual en una sola sesión.
Hasta este momento del juego, los jugadores solo han visto cangrejos en<sb>las cabezas de los zombis.<sb>Esto llevó a los jugadores de prueba familiarizados con los cangrejos de<sb>juegos anteriores a anticiparse a encontrarlos por su cuenta.<sb>Decidimos reproducir esta anticipación prefigurando el primer encuentro de<sb>cangrejo con uno que cae de una rejilla de ventilación antes de<sb>desaparecer, así como sonidos de cangrejo en el entorno, incluido un<sb>sonido amenazante de cangrejo procedente de<sb>la puerta parcialmente cerrada por delante.
Hay dos capas en las marcas en las paredes de esta área: los patrones<sb>cuadrados y de puntos que son los elementos funcionales del acertijo<sb>ambiental y el mural que representa la interpretación de los Vortigaunts de<sb>los eventos de la saga de <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Durante los primeros años de desarrollo, esta área solo contenía los<sb>patrones de puntos que soportaban el acertijo en perspectiva, pero a<sb>medida que desarrollamos el resto del nivel, vimos que los jugadores de<sb>prueba respondieron especialmente positivamente a las marcas de pared de<sb>los Vortigaunts que conducían al escondite.<sb>Fue en este momento que nos dimos cuenta de que esta área podría servir<sb>como lienzo para la obra artística de nuestros Vortigaunts.<sb>Para hacerlo, organizamos los patrones de puntos en una especie de campo<sb>estelar giratorio detrás del arte de los Vortigaunts.<sb>Las imágenes en sí, que se inspiraron en petroglifos y otras artes<sb>rupestres tradicionales, retratan muchos eventos importantes de la<sb>invasión de la Alianza, pintada apresuradamente por el herido Vortigaunt,<sb>casi como si estuviera tratando de capturar los recuerdos fugaces que aún<sb>tenía de la vortesencia de la que había sido separado.<sb>El hecho de que los Vortigaunts tengan una relación complicada con el<sb>tiempo nos dio mucho margen en términos de dibujar esto como una línea de<sb>tiempo estricta y lineal.<sb>Por ejemplo, puedes notar que el Vortigaunt utiliza tropas contemporáneas<sb>de la Alianza como símbolo de invasiones de la Alianza del pasado o que la<sb>línea de tiempo es generalmente confusa: un poco del pasado, un poco del<sb>presente y un poco mirando hacia adelante a los eventos futuros<sb>de <I>Half-Life 2<I>.
Hay muchos temas musicales y motivos utilizados a lo largo del juego para<sb>representar aspectos no hablados de la historia.<sb>Por ejemplo, los Vortigaunts juegan un papel integral en la subtrama del<sb>juego y elegimos usar la música para comunicar subconscientemente la<sb>naturaleza repetitiva de su papel tanto en la línea de tiempo de<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> como en la línea de tiempo más grande de la saga <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Dentro de la música de esta escena, escucharás variaciones de temas<sb>utilizados a lo largo de la línea de tiempo del juego, desde los primeros<sb>sonidos del juego hasta el final en la bóveda.<sb>Variaciones de estos motivos representan el canto encarcelado de los Vortigaunts.<sb><wait:13> La extracción de su energía para confinar al G-Man.<sb><wait:7>Y sonidos históricamente familiares que representan la misma vortesencia.<sb><wait:21>
Durante nuestros primeros intentos de escribir Alyx, nuestro instinto era<sb>que reaccionara a absolutamente todo.<sb>Pero lo que aprendimos de las pruebas de juego fue que el que Alyx<sb>reaccionara demasiado en realidad podría ser molesto.<sb>Digamos que un jugador está en un nivel muy tenso, lleno de zombis, y la<sb>está pasando muy bien, pero de repente, Alyx está en su cabeza sonando<sb>enojada, asustada o ansiosa.<sb>Estas reacciones de Alyx estaban creando una desconexión entre cómo se<sb>sentía el jugador y cómo se sentía el personaje que estaban interpretando.<sb>Así que eliminamos muchas de ellas.<sb>Las reacciones de Alyx que dejamos tendieron a ser las que eran<sb>prácticamente universales.<sb>La reacción de Alyx aquí a la entrada surrealista al escondite vort es un<sb>buen ejemplo, donde era tan diferente de todo lo que el jugador había<sb>visto hasta entonces, y te toma por sorpresa.<sb>Vimos tantas pruebas de juego donde el jugador lo veía y decía: "vaya, qué<sb>extraño". Así que hicimos que Alyx dijera lo mismo un segundo después,<sb>casi como un eco.
Durante todo el tiempo que hemos estado haciendo escenas coreografiadas<sb>como esta, hemos descubierto que hay dos tipos de jugadores: los que se<sb>sumergen con los personajes y los que juegan con todo lo que les rodea y<sb>prestan poca atención a la acción de la escena.<sb>Para que estos entornos sean entretenidos para los que les gusta<sb>interactuar, generalmente agregamos objetos para que los encuentren y<sb>jueguen con ellos.<sb>Dado que esta escena se divide en dos salas, pudimos añadir un gran número<sb>de interacciones en esta primera sala para que los jugadores la<sb>descubrieran después de que el Vortigaunt se haya ido a la segunda sala.<sb>Algunos objetos interactivos son juguetes totalmente físicos, como los<sb>cadáveres colgantes de cangrejo y las sartenes colgantes.<sb>Otras son animaciones activadas por las acciones del jugador, como la<sb>forma en que los cangrejos enjaulados reaccionan al jugador cuando se<sb>acerca o dispara.<sb>Un tipo de objeto sobre la mesa es un corazón de cangrejo exprimible, que<sb>es un resto de una versión antigua de esta escena, donde el jugador debía<sb>revivir un Vortigaunt herido exprimiéndole néctar de estos corazones.<sb>Si bien esa escena no funcionó, nos pareció que la experiencia era<sb>demasiado interesante y, bueno, <I>asquerosa<I>, como para eliminarla por<sb>completo del juego.
El desafío fundamental de cualquier escena dramática coreografiada como<sb>esta es asegurarnos de entretener al jugador sin socavar la entrega de<sb>información importante de juego.<sb>En este caso, el jugador necesitaba salir de esta escena con el<sb>conocimiento de que los Vortigaunts han sido encarcelados y que el jugador<sb>debe buscar la "Estrella del Norte". Esta escena en particular pasó por<sb>muchas variaciones diferentes durante el desarrollo, desde una escena<sb>culinaria con un Vortigaunt extremadamente traumatizado hasta esta versión<sb>humorística.<sb>Incluso experimentamos con una interacción donde el jugador debía apretar<sb>el néctar de varios corazones de cangrejo en la boca del Vortigaunt para<sb>revivirlo.<sb>Si bien esta fue una interacción de realidad virtual memorable y novedosa<sb>que aseguró que los jugadores estuvieran involucrados con la escena, la<sb>interactividad por parte de ellos, a menudo, dio como resultado que<sb>recordaran las <I>acciones<I> que tomaron, pero no la información importante del<sb>juego.<sb>Finalmente, terminamos con esta escena más humorística, que logró un<sb>equilibrio efectivo entre el entretenimiento y la transmisión de objetivos.<sb>Es importante destacar que también distribuimos la escena en<sb>dos salas separadas dividiendo la entrega de información en dos pasos:<sb>la primera sala donde el jugador se reúne y aprende sobre el estado del Vortigaunt, y<sb>la segunda, donde se le da al jugador su nuevo objetivo.<sb>Separarlos físicamente en salas parecía ayudar a los jugadores a retener<sb>de manera más fiable la información importante mostrada en la segunda sala.<sb>Si bien esta escena experimentó muchos cambios, un ritmo de historia<sb>permaneció prácticamente inalterado desde la primera versión: el momento<sb>en que el Vortigaunt lanza un cadáver de cangrejo al jugador y grita<sb>"¡sustento!" Desde el principio, este momento siempre tuvo una gran<sb>reacción de los jugadores de prueba y se mantuvo, hasta el producto final.
Pasamos tiempo en cada elemento de diseño del juego pensando en cómo se<sb>espera que el jugador aprenda de su existencia y entienda sus detalles.<sb>Algunos elementos de diseño son tan importantes que la experiencia del<sb>juego se "rompería" si el jugador no los entiende, mientras que otros<sb>pueden ser diversiones o recompensas por explorar los sistemas del juego.<sb>Cualquier elemento importante requerirá trabajo de nuestra parte para<sb>enseñar al jugador.<sb>En <I>Half-Life<I>, tratamos de enseñar elementos de maneras que se sientan lo<sb>más naturales posibles entrelazados dentro del flujo central del juego<sb>para que no sientas que el juego simplemente se detuvo para enseñarte algo.<sb>No siempre tenemos éxito, pero los intentos generalmente nos llevan a<sb>algún lugar interesante.<sb>En este caso, tenemos que enseñar a los jugadores sobre los cangrejos<sb>armados.<sb>Los elementos clave que queremos que entiendan son que el cangrejo es<sb>invencible en la parte superior, pero tiene un punto débil en su vientre.<sb>También queríamos que el jugador aprendiera que el cangrejo expone su<sb>punto débil justo antes de saltar, pero esto no es necesario. El jugador<sb>puede disparar al punto débil a medida que el cangrejo se mueve después de<sb>un salto.
Enseñar elementos de diseño de enemigos siempre es complicado.<sb>Los jugadores nos han demostrado durante años que es muy difícil aprender<sb>algo nuevo mientras estás bajo ataque.<sb>También hemos visto que la invencibilidad es una característica enemiga<sb>particularmente difícil de enseñar.<sb>Si los jugadores están disparando contra un enemigo, a menudo no están<sb>prestando mucha atención a los comentarios sobre el impacto.<sb>Si el enemigo es vulnerable en algunas áreas y no en otras, los jugadores<sb>pueden matar al enemigo con una ráfaga de disparos sin darse cuenta de que<sb>algunos de sus disparos no hicieron nada, mientras que otros acertaron a<sb>los puntos débiles importantes.<sb>Así que, cuando nos acercamos al entrenamiento de cangrejos blindados,<sb>sabíamos que tendríamos que hacer un buen trabajo.<sb>El primer paso fue evitar poner al jugador bajo presión conteniendo a los<sb>enemigos dentro de esta cerca de alambre.<sb>Luego, colocamos los cangrejos a la altura de los ojos frente al jugador<sb>exponiendo su punto débil de forma brillante y pulsante.<sb>Si el jugador dispara a uno inmediatamente, son recompensados con un<sb>efecto de muerte único donde el cangrejo explota en trozos.<sb>Este efecto está diseñado para mostrar al jugador que hicieron algo<sb>especial para matar a este cangrejo, a diferencia de cómo han estado<sb>matando cangrejos hasta ahora.<sb>Hay un par de otros elementos que son importantes.<sb>Un segundo cangrejo se coloca justo detrás de la cerradura que el jugador<sb>debe disparar para entrar en la jaula, lo que anima al jugador a notar el<sb>punto débil y tratar de disparar.<sb>Dos cangrejos más están sueltos en la jaula programados para atacar<sb>repetidamente puntos invisibles en la cerca de alambre.<sb>Esto asegura que están constantemente demostrando la forma en que exponen<sb>sus puntos débiles antes de saltar, y esto permite al jugador practicar<sb>darle al punto débil desde detrás de la seguridad de la cerca.
Con cualquier sección de entrenamiento natural y entrelazado, hemos<sb>observado que rara vez hay algo que tenga éxito en enseñar a todos los<sb>jugadores, ni el 100% de los jugadores se van con la comprensión perfecta<sb>que nos gustaría.<sb>Si la comprensión del jugador es absolutamente importante, tenemos que<sb>construir algo más contundente que garantice que el jugador demuestre<sb>comprensión antes de seguir.<sb>De hecho, hacemos precisamente eso cuando el jugador adquiere la escopeta<sb>en la siguiente área.<sb>En el caso del cangrejo blindado, sin embargo, las pruebas de juego<sb>mostraron que podíamos permitirnos dejar pasar a unos pocos jugadores con<sb>una comprensión menos perfecta.<sb>Esta sección les dio la oportunidad suficiente de experimentar que tenían<sb>una idea de lo que sucedía, y otros encuentros con cangrejos blindados lo<sb>asentaron.<sb> Todavía hubo mucha iteración en el diseño visual de los cangrejos para<sb>llevar transmitir aún mejor su armadura y punto débil, y también añadimos<sb>una respuesta personalizada específica para el fuego de escopeta.<sb>En ese caso, el cangrejo blindado se voltea y retuerce por un segundo, lo<sb>que expone su punto débil.<sb>Agregamos esto para reducir la pérdida de recursos que vimos que sucedía<sb>en los jugadores que todavía les costaba entender la mecánica de los<sb>cangrejos blindados después de que adquirían la escopeta.
Uno de los desafíos que siempre enfrentamos al darle una nueva arma o<sb>herramienta al jugador es asegurarnos de que la tomen antes de seguir.<sb>En estos casos, tratamos de establecer algún tipo de "puerta" que el<sb>jugador solo puede superar usando el nuevo elemento.<sb>Esto puede ser especialmente complicado en los casos en que le estamos<sb>dando al jugador una nueva herramienta que no cambia fundamentalmente sus<sb>capacidades, como en el caso de la escopeta, donde casi todo lo que se<sb>puede hacer con la escopeta también se puede hacer con la pistola.<sb>Como contraste, la puerta de la pistola, donde el jugador tiene que<sb>adquirir la pistola antes de poder disparar la cerradura de la cerca<sb>contra el laboratorio de Russell, fue fácil de diseñar y ejecutar.<sb>Para esta puerta de escopeta, no solo necesitábamos asegurarnos de que el<sb>jugador recogiera la escopeta, sino también de que aprendiera a cargarla<sb>antes de continuar.<sb>Intentamos varias formas para enseñar la mecánica de recarga durante el<sb>combate, y en repetidas ocasiones encontramos que no funcionaba.<sb>Cuando se enfrentaban a aprender una tarea nueva y compleja bajo presión,<sb>los jugadores cambiaban a la pistola, que era algo más familiar.
Una vez que el jugador tiene la escopeta, solo va a la mitad de la puerta<sb>de la escopeta.<sb>Antes de acabar, necesitan aprender a recargarla.<sb>Para que los jugadores entendieran la necesidad de usar esta nueva arma,<sb>añadimos una amenaza utilizando una variedad de efectos audiovisuales para<sb>demostrarla.<sb>Si bien nuestro objetivo es hacer que el jugador sienta que tiene una<sb>cantidad limitada de tiempo, la presión de tiempo es completamente falsa,<sb>y todo procede en función del progreso del jugador en la carga de la<sb>escopeta por primera vez.<sb>Una vez que la escopeta está cargada, se inicia un breve temporizador,<sb>después del cual, los zombis entran a través de las paredes.<sb>Si el jugador mira las paredes antes de que el temporizador empiece,<sb>abortamos el temporizador e introducimos a los zombis inmediatamente.<sb>La combinación de un temporizador y una activación al ver es un truco<sb>común utilizado en lugares donde nos gustaría que el jugador tenga un<sb>momento visual claro, pero no podemos esperar para siempre o el juego<sb>simplemente no progresará.<sb>La ruptura de las paredes por los zombis es el último paso para abrir la<sb>puerta de la escopeta.<sb>Tener nuevos enemigos abriendo el camino hacia adelante cuando entran en<sb>el espacio del jugador es un método bastante usado, pero nunca es uno con<sb>el que estamos particularmente contentos.<sb>Siempre es demasiado conveniente, y carece de agencia por parte del<sb>jugador.<sb>Pero en una configuración como esta, que contiene un acertijo novedoso,<sb>nuevas armas y sus mecánicas asociadas, además de una emboscada, ya<sb>estamos lidiando con una gran complejidad de diseño empacada en un espacio<sb>pequeño, y otras adiciones complicarían aún más el escenario.
El diseño visual de la escopeta incluyó una serie de desafíos.<sb>Las escopetas en los juegos son generalmente poderosas, y comunicamos esa<sb>potencia a granel.<sb>Como resultado, son grandes y se sostienen en dos manos.<sb>Pero nuestros experimentos con armas de realidad virtual de dos manos no<sb>alcanzaron un nivel con el que estábamos satisfechos.<sb>Al sostener un objeto de dos manos en la vida real, el objeto en sí<sb>proporciona una conexión física entre las dos manos, y esa restricción<sb>permite a los jugadores dejar de pensar en él conscientemente, además de<sb>proporcionar una reacción física.<sb>En la realidad virtual, sin esa conexión o reacción, descubrimos que los<sb>jugadores tenían que mantener su propio sentido interno de cómo sostenían<sb>su arma de dos manos, o movían las manos hacia posiciones que eran<sb>difíciles de ajustar para nosotros.<sb>Como resultado, nuestras dos armas de mano requerían que los jugadores<sb>"pretendieran" más de lo que nos gustaba.<sb>Dado que uno de nuestros objetivos principales con <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> era<sb>permitir que los jugadores se sumergieran completamente al dejar de pensar<sb>en lo que estaban haciendo en la vida real, decidimos centrarnos en las<sb>armas de una sola mano, incluida la escopeta.
Nuestro instinto inicial con el diseño de la escopeta era usar una<sb>escopeta normal del mundo real, pero modificada con una culata y un cañón<sb>aserrados para que pareciera menos engorroso cuando se sujeta con una mano.<sb>Este enfoque siempre resultó en que el mango estuviera en la parte trasera<sb>del arma y nos topamos con el problema de que el arma siempre se sentía<sb>pesada en la parte delantera.<sb>Obviamente, el control de realidad virtual en la mano no refleja eso, pues<sb>provocaría una desconexión entre lo que sientes y lo que ves.<sb>Colocar el asa más centralmente, y debajo del arma, ayudó a evitar esta<sb>desconexión.<sb>Este centro de masa implícito no se mantuvo tan bien como las mejoras<sb>acumuladas del arma a lo largo del juego, pero la primera impresión fue la<sb>más importante.<sb>Como íbamos con una forma extraña, estábamos muy interesados en usar<sb>elementos visuales de escopeta comunes donde pudiéramos para ayudar con el<sb>reconocimiento del jugador y para afianzar el diseño como algo realista.<sb>Un elemento que tomamos prestado fue un cargador de tubo de escopeta común<sb>que almacena los proyectiles horizontalmente en línea con el cañón, y solo<sb>pudimos adaptarnos al requisito de juego de 6 proyectiles sin que la<sb>longitud total se volviera difícil de manejar.<sb>Se puede ver todo el esfuerzo que tuvimos que poner para obtener más<sb>capacidad de proyectiles en el diseño de nuestra mejora de cargador<sb>automático. Nuestra primera mecánica de recarga se basó en la inserción<sb>realista de un proyectil a la vez.<sb>Los jugadores de prueba vieron que esto era demasiado tedioso, aunque<sb>recibimos algunos comentarios positivos que los hicieron sentir como una<sb>estrella de cine de acción.<sb>La simple adición de permitir a los jugadores insertar dos proyectiles a<sb>la vez resolvió este problema, lo que nos dejó mantener la parte buena del<sb>diseño mientras perdíamos la mala.<sb>Estábamos ansiosos por reforzar todo lo del aspecto de sentirse como<sb>estrella de acción y experimentamos con un gran gesto que el jugador podía<sb>hacer para finalizar la recarga.<sb>La inclusión de un mecanismo de levantar nos permitió también agregar un<sb>paso adicional a la recarga que lo separó aún más de nuestras otras armas,<sb>pero con un movimiento satisfactorio de la muñeca para completar la acción.
Al igual que con la escopeta y la pistola, necesitábamos una puerta para<sb>la linterna para garantizar que el jugador no pudiera continuar sin ella.<sb>Probamos un numero de diseños en torno al momento en que el jugador tomara<sb>la linterna, pero todos terminaron basándose en que el jugador levantara<sb>un objeto, no necesariamente en que el objeto tuviera que ser la linterna.<sb>Dado que la función principal de la linterna es proporcionar luz, sentimos<sb>que la puerta necesitaba ser un área de oscuridad.<sb>También queríamos que el jugador estuviera emocionado de conseguir la<sb>linterna, y eso significaba que tenía que experimentar la oscuridad antes<sb>de recoger la linterna.<sb>Esto resultó ser un desafío interesante, porque ya teníamos muchas áreas<sb>mal iluminadas antes de esto, y ahora necesitábamos un área que fuera tan<sb>oscura que los jugadores la interpretaran correctamente como una puerta.<sb>Nuestra implementación inicial fue simplemente para asegurar que no<sb>hubiera luces dentro del pasillo.<sb>Desafortunadamente, las pruebas de juego inmediatamente mostraron que eso<sb>no era suficiente.<sb>Algunos cascos de realidad virtual tienen niveles negros extremadamente<sb>bajos, y en esos cascos, suficiente luz rebotaba desde esta área<sb>iluminada, lo que permitía a los jugadores avanzar.<sb>Además, nuestra niebla de suelo bajo proporcionó suficiente contraste en<sb>el pasillo oscuro para que los jugadores pudieran distinguir la escena y<sb>encontrarla.<sb>Incluso una vez que eliminamos la niebla y la luz de rebote en esta área,<sb>vimos otras formas en que los jugadores intentaron avanzar.<sb>Algunos jugadores disparaban su pistola repetidamente, usando el destello<sb>de los disparos como una fuente de luz intermitente.<sb>Otros utilizaban la interfaz de selección de destino del teletransportador<sb>para explorar el cuatro, la cual tenía incorporada una pequeña fuente de<sb>luz durante esta etapa del desarrollo.<sb>Al final, desactivamos el destello de las armas en ese pasillo y retiramos<sb>la iluminación del teletransportador.<sb>El paso final fue la adición de un diálogo de Alyx comentando sobre la<sb>oscuridad y su necesidad de una fuente de luz.<sb>Esto tenía como objetivo resolver un problema perceptivo.<sb>Hasta ahora, nuestro juego ha enseñado a los jugadores que su objetivo es<sb>seguir avanzando, y en cualquier momento que se bloquee el progreso hacia<sb>adelante, es porque hay algo en el área que se debe resolver.<sb>Dada esa estructura, es totalmente racional que los jugadores hagan todo<sb>lo posible para encontrar alguna manera de ver en la oscuridad que se<sb>avecina.<sb>El diálogo de Alyx es para decirle al jugador que el juego ha reconocido<sb>sus intentos de avanzar aquí, pero la solución se encuentra en otra parte.<sb>Las pruebas siguientes demostraron que este dialogo, en combinación con la<sb>zona iluminada llena de zombis a la derecha, ayudaba a guiar a los<sb>jugadores hacia la linterna en lugar de la entrada oscura.
Al igual que los acertijos ambientales y de hackeo, los de conexión de la<sb>corriente eléctrica como este servían para liberar la tensión del combate<sb>y ocupar la mente del jugador de nuevas formas.<sb>Este acertijo introduce un nuevo tipo de unión, que tiene dos entradas y<sb>dos salidas, así como circuitos ramificados.<sb>En forma concreta, es una simple "escotilla". Solo puede activarse una<sb>puerta de la Alianza a la vez, con la complicación adicional que la puerta<sb>lateral más pequeña en el camino de regreso debe desactivarse de forma<sb>separada.<sb>Además de otorgar un descanso entre encuentros de combate caóticos, este<sb>acertijo sirve como recordatorio de ciertas mecánicas de juego, pues ha<sb>pasado algo de tiempo desde que el jugador vio un acertijo de conexión de<sb>la corriente eléctrica y los que siguen se vuelven cada vez más complejos.
En juegos anteriores de <I>Half-Life<I>, la linterna estaba conectada al cuerpo<sb>del jugador, lo que significaba que siempre iluminaba el mundo desde el<sb>mismo ángulo en relación con el punto de vista del jugador.<sb>Con las manos rastreadas en realidad virtual, tuvimos la oportunidad de<sb>dejar que los jugadores manipularan la linterna directamente y los<sb>jugadores de prueba reaccionaron muy positivamente a esta nueva libertad.<sb>De hecho, nuestra primera implementación de una linterna en<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> fue un objeto que se podía recoger en cualquier mano o<sb>incluso retroceder.<sb>Esto le permitió al jugador colocar la linterna en algún lugar, lo que<sb>proporcionaba iluminación para sí mismo mientras realizaba otra tarea.<sb>Desafortunadamente, esto presentó la posibilidad de que un jugador pudiera<sb>perder la linterna, lo que rompería el flujo del juego.<sb>Implementar la linterna como un objeto que los jugadores tuvieran que<sb>sostener también impedía que sostuvieran algo <I>más<I> en esa mano, lo cual se<sb>volvía tedioso y era simplemente una desventaja demasiado importante.<sb>En particular, hacía que recargar armas se volviera una pesadilla, ya que<sb>el jugador no disponía de una mano libre para realizar los movimientos de<sb>recarga.<sb>Al final, decidimos implementar una linterna que se conectara a la mano no<sb>dominante y se prendiera y apagara "automáticamente". Esto resolvió el<sb>problema de recargar en la oscuridad, la posibilidad de perder la linterna<sb>y tuvo la ventaja adicional de no requerir un botón extra para activar la<sb>luz, lo cual es especialmente práctico para los controles con pocos<sb>botones.<sb>Ya que el comportamiento de prendido y apagado automático es controlado<sb>por lógica de niveles, esto permitió a los diseñadores alterar el balance<sb>entre calidad y rendimiento en distintas áreas del juego.<sb>Después de todo, si un jugador pudiera encender la linterna en cualquier<sb>momento, la sobrecarga de renderizado de esta fuente de luz de sombra<sb>tendría que ser contabilizada a lo largo de todo el juego.<sb>Por otra parte, si es posible estar seguro de que la linterna estará<sb><I>apagada<I> en un área determinada, un diseñador puede aprovechar esa<sb>capacidad de procesamiento para mejorar la fidelidad del entorno en otras<sb>maneras.
Poco después de implementar la linterna, notamos que los jugadores de<sb>prueba solían usar la mano con la linterna para estabilizar la mano que<sb>usaban para sostener el arma.<sb>Esto los forzaba a orientar la linterna de una forma bastante tosca para<sb>poder alinear la luz con la mira del arma.<sb>Decidimos automatizar este comportamiento de la mano no dominante siempre<sb>que se acercara al mango del arma.<sb>Si realizas esta acción, notarás que la mano no dominante sostiene el arma<sb>en una pose natural y la linterna se alinea con la mira.<sb>En realidad, si miras con cuidado el extremo de la linterna, notarás que<sb>tiene una rótula articulada.<sb>Esto le permite a la linterna girar dependiendo de si la mano está<sb>aferrada o no al arma.<sb>La rótula articulada tiene cuatro orientaciones diferentes: una para cada<sb>arma y una orientación neutral para cuando el jugador no está<sb>estabilizando la mano que sostiene el arma.<sb>Estas cuatro orientaciones aseguran que la linterna siempre apunte en la<sb>dirección óptima para el jugador.<sb>En el modo de una mano, la linterna se ajusta a la mano del arma en un<sb>ángulo que sea ideal para cualquier situación.
Cuando los escritores creamos un nuevo personaje, intentamos escribir una<sb>variedad de material desde la perspectiva del personaje para ayudarnos a<sb>encontrar su voz.<sb>¿Qué los motiva? ¿Cómo hablan? ¿Qué relación tienen con otros personajes?<sb>Siempre es útil saber la respuesta a estas preguntas al comienzo de un<sb>proyecto, especialmente al trabajar en un equipo donde varias personas<sb>terminarán escribiendo ese personaje.<sb>La historia del "club sándwich" que Russell cuenta en esta sección comenzó<sb>como uno de estos ejercicios.<sb>El equipo de escritores redacto páginas y páginas de historias que Russell<sb>le contaba a Alyx sobre la vida antes de la Alianza, enojándose con ella,<sb>contando malos chistes; esencialmente, todo el espectro de emociones.<sb>A medida que refinamos la personalidad de Russell, casi todo esto quedó<sb>abandonado.<sb>Tuvimos que hacer todo ese trabajo para entender a Russell, pero la<sb>mayoría ya no sonaba como Russell.<sb>Más adelante en el proyecto, decidimos que Alyx le tendría miedo a la<sb>oscuridad.<sb>De modo que tuvimos que hacer que Russell hablara mucho en esta sección<sb>para hacerle compañía.<sb>No importaba <I>qué<I> era lo que dijera, solo necesitaba ser una voz en la<sb>oscuridad a la que ella pudiera aferrarse.<sb>Y entonces, lo recordamos: "¿oye, no escribimos ese largo monólogo sobre<sb>un sándwich?" Y así resucitamos el discurso del club sándwich.
Al diseñar un juego de <I>Half-Life<I>, siempre intentamos comenzar con las<sb>pruebas de juego lo antes posible, incluso si solo tenemos 10 o 15 minutos<sb>de juego programado.<sb>Nos resulta de extrema utilidad saber lo antes posible cómo es que los<sb>jugadores reaccionan a lo que construimos.<sb>Una de las influencias principales de las pruebas de juego en<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> fue revelar cómo es que los jugadores reaccionaban frente<sb>a la densidad de elementos interactivos en el mundo.<sb>Antes de comenzar, ya suponíamos que los jugadores pasarían más tiempo<sb>prestando atención a los detalles del mundo en realidad virtual, pero no<sb>estábamos preparados para lo intenso que esto sería.<sb>Observar a algunos jugadores pasar treinta minutos jugando con solo un<sb>objeto verdaderamente nos abrió los ojos.<sb>Como resultado de estas observaciones, dedicamos mucho de nuestro tiempo<sb>de desarrollo al entorno que rodea al jugador, y al nivel de detalle e<sb>interactividad que encontraría allí.<sb>Puede sonar extraño que no comenzáramos con asumir que tendríamos que<sb>dedicar tanto tiempo al entorno, pero la realidad del desarrollo de juegos<sb>es que siempre tenemos un tiempo limitado y siempre hay que tener<sb>compromisos.<sb>En una situación ideal, dedicamos nuestro limitado tiempo a lo que sea que<sb>más contribuya a la experiencia del jugador.<sb>De modo que realizar pruebas tempranas y, por lo tanto, obtener una mejor<sb>idea sobre qué elementos contribuyen a la experiencia del jugador, nos<sb>ayuda a saber a qué dedicar ese tiempo.<sb>En este caso, esas pruebas iniciales nos indicaron que debíamos<sb>incrementar de forma considerable los esfuerzos dedicados a crear un mundo<sb>más detallado e interactivo.
Las lapas son un enemigo único en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, en el sentido que son<sb>estáticos y a menudo se encuentran por encima del campo visual natural del<sb>jugador.<sb>Al realizar pruebas en espacios pequeños o poco iluminados, a menudo<sb>observamos a jugadores toparse con las lenguas de las lapas sin haber<sb>notado que estaban allí.<sb>Una solución que encontramos a esto fue mediante el uso de sonidos.<sb>En particular, hicimos que las lapas emitieran sonidos sutiles al<sb>respirar, croar o gruñir como lo que escucharás a continuación.<sb><wait:9>Esos sonidos ayudaron a alertar a los jugadores sobre la presencia de las<sb>lapas a la vez que las hacen parecer criaturas vivientes, en lugar de ser<sb>solo elementos mecánicos que responden a las acciones del jugador.<sb>La función de transferencia relacionada con la cabeza del audio de Steam<sb>fue particularmente útil para posicionar de forma convincente los sonidos<sb>de las lapas, de modo que los jugadores notaran que estos venían de arriba.
Las primeras versiones de las robosierras resultaban bastante frustrantes<sb>en realidad virtual ya que su audio no proporcionaba suficiente<sb>información sobre dónde estaban posicionadas.<sb>Parecían aparecer de la nada, e incluso cuando estaban cerca del jugador.<sb>Su presencia no era lo suficientemente dramática.<sb>Probamos con varios niveles de sonidos con diferentes distancias de<sb>atenuación del volumen, pero esto a menudo creaba incluso más confusión,<sb>especialmente cuando había más de una robosierra a la vez.<sb>Nuestra solución final fue en dos partes diferentes.<sb>La primera fue hacer que las robosierras emitieran un sonido de alarma al<sb>entrar en alcance, o cuando eran activadas por un soldado de la Alianza.<sb><wait:2>La segunda parte fue agregar repeticiones de sonidos más agresivos con<sb>distancias de atenuación más cortas.<sb><wait:4>Las distancias de atenuación más cortas significaron que este componente<sb>de los sonidos de las robosierras solo podría escucharse a corta distancia<sb>del jugador.<sb>De esta forma, una vez que escucharan estos ruidos, los jugadores sabrían<sb>que las robosierras los estaban cazando y que al menos una estaba lo<sb>suficientemente cerca para ser un problema.
Antes de agregar los últimos elementos gráficos, no solía tomar mucho<sb>tiempo atravesar las áreas estrechas y oscuras.<sb>Pero, a medida que la fidelidad del juego aumentaba, los jugadores<sb>tardaban más y más en llegar a este punto.<sb>Como hemos aprendido a lo largo de los años, el pasar demasiado tiempo en<sb>áreas oscuras y subterráneas puede ser agotador para los jugadores, y esto<sb>es incluso más importante en realidad virtual.<sb>Esta sección al aire libre permite un cambio de ritmo y un breve descanso<sb>de la oscuridad.<sb>No solo les da a los jugadores algo interesante y visualmente diferente,<sb>les permite también observar y juzgar claramente las amenazas en un<sb>espacio abierto, lo que permite lograr algunas victorias fáciles con poco<sb>estrés.<sb>También era importante proporcionar variedad aquí, dado que los jugadores<sb>estaban a punto de entrar en un área que requeriría disparos precisos y el<sb>uso de la linterna.
Esta sección, con una multitud de barriles explosivos cubiertos de<sb>infestación de Xen, estaba diseñada para alterar las expectativas de los<sb>jugadores y cambiar el ritmo del nivel.<sb>Hasta este punto del juego, los barriles y contenedores explosivos se<sb>usaban como armas ofensivas.<sb>En esta área, dañan al jugador; si un barril explota, desatará una<sb>reacción en cadena letal.<sb>Este cambio en las prioridades fuerza al jugador a apuntar con cuidado y<sb>agrega intensidad sin la necesidad de combate.<sb>Esto también tiene el beneficio secundario de entrenar al jugador para<sb>utilizar la pistola de una forma más efectiva.<sb>Si bien el alineamiento automático de la linterna con un arma sujetada es<sb>útil en combate directo, en esta área, observamos a los jugadores tomar<sb>ventaja de la linterna y el arma por separado al iluminar y apuntar a las<sb>lapas en la rebuscada vegetación Xen encima de sus cabezas.
Decidimos de forma muy anticipada que los entornos que queríamos presentar<sb>en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> se beneficiarían de una inversión en iluminación<sb>volumétrica de alta calidad.<sb>Este componente de iluminación es indispensable, no solo como herramienta<sb>para dar vida al ambiente, sino también para guiar la atención del jugador<sb>a elementos de jugabilidad importantes.<sb>Nuestro sistema funciona en tres fases.<sb>En la primera fase, la luz de una fuente estática es capturada en un<sb>clipmap volumétrico jerárquico de tres niveles alrededor al jugador.<sb>El más alto nivel de resolución del clipmap mide una pulgada cúbica por<sb>voxel.<sb>El clipmap se actualiza de forma gradual, menos de una vez por cuadro, a<sb>medida que el jugador se mueve por la escena.<sb>En la segunda escena, el sombreador de cálculo ejecuta ray marching por el<sb>espacio de visión de los clipmaps, lo que acumula iluminación estática,<sb>iluminación dinámica y extinción volumétrica.<sb>El ray marching se ejecuta en cada cuadro y emplea anti aliasing temporal<sb>para mejorar la calidad.<sb>En la fase final, volvemos a capturar una muestra de luz y dispersión<sb>volumétrica de la fase anterior para cada ojo, una vez por cuadro.<sb>El resultado es una textura que describe dispersión y extinción<sb>volumétricas para cualquier espacio de visión dado, las cuales aplicamos<sb>al momento del renderizado adelantado.
Siempre introducimos enemigos nuevos a distancia y nunca mientras el<sb>jugador se siente presionado.<sb>Aquí, el jugador puede observar a los soldados de la Alianza matando<sb>algunos zombis ambulantes, lo que da una idea de lo poderosos que son los<sb>soldados y cómo operan durante el combate.<sb>Colocamos a los soldados de la Alianza los suficientemente lejos para que<sb>fuera creíble que no notaran al jugador, pero suficientemente cerca para<sb>que puedan elegir atacarlos y a la vez<sb>estar relativamente a salvo de su contraataque.
El primer encuentro con un soldado de la Alianza causó muchos problemas<sb>durante las pruebas.<sb>El primero es que los jugadores a menudo se sorprendían cuando el soldado<sb>comenzaba a dispararles.<sb>Algunos jugadores sin experiencia con la serie de <I>Half-Life<I> no tenían idea<sb>de quiénes eran estos soldados.<sb>Pero también han pasado horas desde que el jugador ha visto a otro ser<sb>humano y descubrimos que muchos jugadores no estaban dispuestos a disparar<sb>de inmediato.<sb>Algunos también se preguntaron por qué Alyx estaba tan dispuesta a matar a<sb>otros seres humanos.<sb>Diseñamos esta área para demonstrar que los soldados de la Alianza son<sb>hostiles y dispararan a primera vista, lo que le da al jugador una razón<sb>para contraatacar.<sb>Comienza con un dialogo antes del encuentro, en el que el jugador escucha<sb>al soldado de la Alianza discutir el problema de buscatesoros en la zona<sb>de cuarentena.<sb>Luego, cuando el jugador finalmente logra el primer contacto visual con un<sb>soldado de la Alianza, lo observan ejecutar a un buscatesoros civil.
La inteligencia artificial de los escuadrones de soldados ha sido un<sb>componente clásico de la serie de <I>Half-Life<I>, de modo que estábamos muy<sb>emocionados por ver cómo el traspaso a la realidad virtual impactaría su<sb>diseño.<sb>Nuestras pruebas iniciales de la inteligencia artificial de la Alianza de<sb><I>Half-Life 2<I> en realidad virtual inmediatamente dejaron en claro algunos<sb>puntos.<sb>Primero, que a los jugadores no les agrada que les dispararan, y a menudo<sb>responden de forma muy negativa.<sb>Los soldados solían correr hacia el jugador a toda velocidad a la vez que<sb>disparaban, y nos dimos cuenta de que la velocidad de combate de<sb><I>Half-Life 2<I> era demasiado para la realidad virtual.<sb>Además, los jugadores tardaron más tiempo en hacer todo lo que estaba a su<sb>alcance en realidad virtual, especialmente la acción central de detectar y<sb>apuntar su arma a un enemigo mientras permanecían a cubierto.<sb>Como resultado, los soldados tendían a vivir mucho más tiempo en realidad<sb>virtual que en <I>Half-Life 2<I>. De estas primeras pruebas de juego se<sb>desprendía claramente que la reacción más común entre los jugadores era<sb>buscar inmediatamente protección contra el fuego enemigo.<sb>Así que empezamos a experimentar con cambios en la inteligencia artificial<sb>de los soldados con el objetivo de construir una experiencia de combate en<sb>torno a la tendencia de los jugadores a buscar cobertura.<sb>Los primeros experimentos se centraron en mantener a los soldados de la<sb>Alianza a una distancia cómoda del jugador, mientras los mantenían<sb>moviéndose lo suficiente como para que el combate no se volviera demasiado<sb>estático.<sb>Para crear pausas en el disparo para que los jugadores se asomen de la<sb>cubierta, evitamos que los soldados dispararan mientras corrían en la<sb>mayoría de los casos.<sb>Para evitar que los jugadores permanezcan inmóviles, creamos un concepto<sb>de "lavado", donde los escuadrones intentarán sacar al jugador de la<sb>cobertura, y le dimos a cada clase de soldado un método diferente para<sb>presionar al jugador.<sb>Pero incluso en estas primeras pruebas, también estaba claro que los<sb>jugadores no eran capaces de luchar contra los soldados hasta que se<sb>hubieran capacitado en una serie de acciones básicas de combate, como<sb>recargar su arma sin tener que centrar toda su atención en ella.<sb>Así que tuvimos cuidado de introducir lentamente los diversos tipos de<sb>soldados, e incluso las características individuales dentro de las clases<sb>de soldados.<sb>Por ejemplo, estas primeras peleas contra los soldados de la Alianza solo<sb>cuentan con los soldados básicos, y estos soldados en particular no llevan<sb>granadas.<sb>Esto significa que, en realidad, no tienen la capacidad de sacar a un<sb>jugador de cobertura.<sb>Descubrimos que era importante en estas primeras peleas dar a los<sb>jugadores todo el tiempo que necesitan para aprender a usar la cobertura<sb>de manera efectiva, antes de empezar a introducir enemigos que podrían<sb>tratar de presionarlos.
En este momento del juego, sabíamos que necesitábamos un momento sin<sb>combate para recompensar a los jugadores por abrirse camino a través de<sb>los oscuros y aterradores túneles.<sb>No solo eso, sino que el ritmo de la historia estaba conduciendo a su<sb>momento más importante hasta ahora: el rescate de Eli Vance.<sb>Chocar el tren de la prisión la Alianza que transportaba a Eli se sentía<sb>exactamente como lo correcto para lograr estos objetivos y nos dio la<sb>oportunidad de crear un espectáculo de realidad virtual.<sb>Queríamos lograr el caos cinematográfico de causar un accidente de tren<sb>mientras dábamos a los jugadores un papel activo en el evento.<sb>Nuestros primeros intentos de diseñar el escenario fueron un desafío.<sb>Resultó que dirigir la atención del jugador no era tan simple como<sb>asegurarse de que estuvieran en la posición correcta a través del juego.<sb>En nuestras pruebas iniciales, los jugadores a menudo no pudieron ver<sb>algunos o todos los espectaculares restos del tren. El accidente fue una<sb>de las primeras secuencias de destrucción que pusimos en el juego, por lo<sb>que tuvimos mucho que aprender sobre el comportamiento del jugador en<sb>realidad virtual y cómo dirigirlo naturalmente para sumergirlo en el caos.<sb>Además, para alcanzar continuamente nuestra tasa de fotogramas objetivo,<sb>necesitábamos crear una serie de eventos en cascada, de modo que solo<sb>parte de la destrucción estuviera ocurriendo en un momento dado.<sb>El diseño de sonido, el diseño de nivel, los efectos y la animación<sb>tuvieron que coordinarse cuidadosamente para dirigir la atención del<sb>jugador a través de cada etapa del accidente.<sb>Por ejemplo, al inicio del accidente, usamos los sonidos de vagones de<sb>tren amontonándose en la distancia, alentando a los jugadores a mirar en<sb>esa dirección antes de que uno de los vagones de tren se levanta y explota<sb>a través del conector de concreto.<sb>Al final de la secuencia, el colapso de la chimenea se utiliza para<sb>dirigir la atención del jugador hacia el camino adelante y queríamos que<sb>los jugadores presenciaran su destrucción.<sb>Antes de bajar la chimenea, dimos a los jugadores un breve momento de<sb>descanso y, de nuevo, usamos el sonido para llamar su atención sobre la<sb>chimenea.<sb>Inicialmente, usamos un sonido retumbante antes de su colapso, pero<sb>encontramos que esto era demasiado sutil en la práctica y en su lugar<sb>añadimos el sonido de explosión transitoria que atrajo la atención del<sb>jugador hacia la chimenea de forma más confiable.
Para el rescate de Eli, queríamos crear un momento tenso "fuera de alcance"<sb>donde el jugador lo salvara físicamente.<sb>Pero, para que el resto de la historia funcionara, Alyx y Eli tuvieron que<sb>tomar diferentes caminos al final de la escena.<sb>Intentamos algunos enfoques diferentes, incluyendo una versión donde Eli<sb>colgaba de una cornisa justo enfrente del jugador y el jugador podía bajar<sb>para intentar agarrar la mano de Eli para halarlo.<sb>En la práctica, sin embargo, las manos de los jugadores chocaban con el<sb>suelo del mundo real.<sb>Esto no solo hizo imposible llegar a Eli, sino que sacó a los jugadores<sb>del momento, lo que arruinaba la emoción de la escena.<sb>Ya que Eli y Alyx tuvieron que tomar caminos diferentes, intentamos un<sb>acercamiento donde Alyx rescataba a Eli, pero él estaba herido y no podía<sb>continuar.<sb>Por desgracia, muchos jugadores se quedaban sin querer abandonarlo.<sb>Finalmente, llegamos a la solución que se quedó en el producto final.<sb>Separar a Eli del jugador con el rescate del Vortigaunt hizo que el<sb>retorno y el cumplimiento de la promesa del Vortigaunt de ayudar a Alyx<sb>fueran mucho más importantes.<sb>El dispositivo que Eli encontró fue una adición que no solo nos permitió<sb>integrar a Eli en la historia más tarde, sino que también le dio algo para<sb>hacerlo, por lo que había una razón mucho más fuerte por la que no<sb>acompañaría al jugador en su viaje hacia adelante.
Al principio del proyecto, pasamos un tiempo experimentando con la clásica<sb>palanca de <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Las pruebas de juego nos mostraron que era una herramienta interesante<sb>para nuestro jugador para usar en acertijos e interacciones del mundo,<sb>pero no estábamos muy contentos con la forma en que resultaron nuestros<sb>esfuerzos de combate cuerpo a cuerpo.<sb>Sentimos que era muy importante que la palanca fuera sólida para el mundo<sb>y los enemigos, y eso resultó en algunos desafíos físicos complicados.<sb>Los jugadores podían fácilmente empujar la palanca hacia un enemigo frente<sb>a ellos, porque nada en el mundo real la detendría.<sb>De hecho, sin esa interacción física del mundo real, descubrimos que los<sb>jugadores de prueba exhibieron una amplia variedad de comportamientos de<sb>técnicas de golpe.<sb>Algunos movían el control rápidamente, otros ponían toda su fuerza<sb>corporal.<sb>Al mismo tiempo, la respuesta de prueba a nuestro prototipo de pistola fue<sb>muy positiva, especialmente en torno a la mecánica de recarga más compleja.<sb>Ante un problema de investigación y desarrollo potencialmente importante<sb>en el combate cuerpo a cuerpo, decidimos reorientar nuestros esfuerzos en<sb>el combate a distancia.<sb>Tampoco ayudó que todos los jugadores asociaran la palanca con Gordon<sb>Freeman, no con Alyx Vance.
Toda esta sección del mapa, desde el inicio del acertijo de la tarjeta de<sb>acceso hasta esta sala, se agregó específicamente para mostrar al jugador<sb>la bóveda.<sb>Sin este pequeño desvío, los jugadores tendrían su primera vista de la<sb>bóveda a la entrada del Hotel Estrella del Norte, que también era cuando<sb>verían su primera subestación de la Alianza.<sb>Tanta información nueva a la vez llevó a muchos jugadores a confundir la<sb>bóveda con la subestación o simplemente a perderla por completo, así que<sb>creamos esta área de la estación de tren para resaltar la bóveda por sí<sb>sola.<sb>A pesar de que los jugadores están obligados a entrar en esta habitación<sb>para obtener la segunda tarjeta de acceso, todavía no necesariamente<sb>notarían la bóveda exterior, por lo que agregamos un diálogo con Russell<sb>sobre mirar por la ventana para verla.<sb>Esto puede ser un poco pesado, pero fue necesario resolver el problema de<sb>los jugadores que no reconocían la bóveda cuando la vieron más adelante en<sb>el juego.
Aunque puede parecer obvio que lanzar sería una interacción trivial<sb>compatible con la realidad virtual, se requiere mucho trabajo<sb>matizado para que se sienta bien.<sb>Y si íbamos a construir acertijo como este, donde el jugador debe lanzar<sb>una granada armada a través de un conducto alto,<sb>el lanzamiento tenía que funcionar bien.<sb>Un juego de realidad virtual típico que se ejecuta a 90 fotogramas por<sb>segundo leerá los datos del sensor de<sb>los controles rastreados una vez por fotograma.<sb>Esto significa que los datos se leen cada 11 milisegundos.<sb>Eso puede parecer un corto lapso, pero al lanzar, un usuario puede mover<sb>fácilmente su mano 15 cm o más en esa cantidad de tiempo.<sb>Además, el jugador puede soltar el objeto abriendo su mano o soltando<sb>el gatillo en cualquier momento durante<cr>su movimiento de lanzamiento.<sb>Esto hace que reconstruir el acto de lanzar un objeto virtual sea un<sb>interesante problema de procesamiento de señales.<sb>Depende de cualquier pieza de software de realidad virtual derivar la<sb>intención del jugador de los datos del control muestreados discretamente y<sb>hemos aprendido mucho a lo largo de los años sobre lo que funciona y lo<sb>que no.<sb>En <I>The Lab<I>, que lanzamos en 2016, tomamos muestras de los datos<sb>posicionales del control cada 11 ms y utilizamos las posiciones<sb>muestreadas para calcular la velocidad del control en cada paso del tiempo.<sb>Luego, usamos un promedio de la velocidad y dirección calculadas en varios<sb>fotogramas antes y después de la liberación del objeto para determinar la<sb>velocidad y la dirección a aplicar al objeto lanzado.<sb>Aunque esto era lo suficientemente funcional, no siempre se sentía<sb>consistente, especialmente si la velocidad de fotogramas del juego caía<sb>por debajo de 90 fotogramas por segundo.<sb>Más tarde, en el demo técnico de control<cr>de dedos índice,<I>Moondust<I>,<sb>ampliamos este algoritmo al inclinarnos hacia datos de mayor velocidad.<sb>También ampliamos la interfaz del software SteamVR para proporcionar<sb>los datos instantáneos de velocidad y aceleración del control desde la unidad<sb>de medición inercial de hardware, que se calcula en el control cada 2 milisegundos.<sb>Esto significaba que no teníamos que calcular una estimación a partir de<sb>las posiciones muestreadas por el motor solo cada 11 milisegundos,<sb>como habíamos hecho en <I>The Lab<I>.<sb>Esto fue crucial para proporcionar una sensación más receptiva, ya que<sb>significaba que los cálculos de lanzamiento ya no estaban vinculados a la<sb>velocidad de procesamiento de fotogramas.<sb>Después de más experimentación, llegamos a la solución utilizada en<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, que toma diez fotogramas que precedieron a la liberación<sb>del objeto retenido y promedia los tres fotogramas que encierran la<sb>velocidad máxima del control en ese tiempo.<sb>Hemos descubierto que esto tiende a conducir a una mejor aproximación de<sb>exactamente cuándo el jugador tenía la intención de liberar<sb>un objeto lanzado.<sb>Este enfoque resultó en un lanzamiento consistente y cómodo, lo que nos<sb>permite confiar en que los jugadores puedan lanzar granadas con precisión,<sb>o cualquier otro objeto, con confianza.
Este acertijo de conexión de la corriente eléctrica opcional está<sb>destinado a entrenar a los jugadores para no hacer clic ciegamente en cada<sb>unión sin entender primero las implicaciones.<sb>Este acertijo en particular está diseñado para tener el efecto secundario<sb>de activar una alarma de incendio si el jugador simplemente hace clic en<sb>cada cruce de conexión que encuentran sin mirar hacia adelante.<sb>Un jugador observador puede resolver fácilmente el acertijo sin activar la<sb>alarma, pero un jugador descuidado activará la alarma, haciendo que un<sb>soldado la Alianza venga atacando desde la esquina para investigar el<sb>ruido.
Los jugadores típicos pasan hasta dos horas progresando a través de los<sb>espacios interiores del Hotel Estrella del Norte y encontramos en las<sb>pruebas de juego que a menudo tenían problemas para recordar su próximo<sb>objetivo de atacar la subestación de la Alianza anterior.<sb>En pruebas anteriores, la bóveda recordaba constantemente a los jugadores<sb>su presencia emitiendo un patrón musical abstracto repetitivo.<sb><wait:18>Este patrón funcionó tan bien para atraer y mantener la atención del<sb>jugador que lo expandimos e hicimos ficción como un patrón de diseño de<sb>sonido semimusical que cambiamos para emitir desde la subestación de la<sb>Alianza que lo representa recolectando y transmitiendo energía Vortigaunt<sb>a la bóveda.<sb><wait:18>Mientras está en el hotel, el jugador no tiene línea de visión a la<sb>subestación, por lo que repetimos este patrón sónico en diversos volúmenes<sb>dentro del hotel como recordatorio de la subestación de la Alianza y la<sb>bóveda exterior.<sb><wait:10>De hecho, si observas de cerca la vegetación Xen cuando estás en el hotel,<sb>notarás que reacciona visiblemente al derrame de energía Vortigaunt a<sb>medida que fluye desde la subestación.
Dada la gran cantidad de botellas a lo largo del juego y el hecho de que<sb>se presentan de manera tan considerable en la jugabilidad de destilería,<sb>decidimos hacer que interactuar con ellas sea lo más interesante posible<sb>utilizando un efecto líquido generado.<sb>A cada botella se le asigna un nivel de llenado aleatorio, y los valores<sb>de la cantidad de agitación líquida y espuma se calculan en función del<sb>movimiento de la botella.<sb>Esto se guarda en el color del objeto que de otro modo no se usaría.<sb>El sombreador calcula el nivel de líquido en función de la orientación de<sb>la botella en el juego, ya que la cantidad de líquido visible en una<sb>botella como proporción de su altura, es diferente cuando se orienta hacia<sb>arriba, hacia los lados o al revés, se utilizan diferentes valores para<sb>cada uno con el fin de preservar el volumen aparente de líquido en el<sb>interior.<sb>Entonces, la superficie del líquido se desplaza por una serie de ondas<sb>sinusoidales, moduladas con el valor de agitación para crear ondas.<sb>Las áreas determinadas para contener líquido, a diferencia del aire,<sb>asumen los valores del color y del índice de refracción de ese líquido.<sb>Se añaden burbujas y efectos de espuma en función de los valores de<sb>agitación y espuma.<sb>Estos son procedimientos y se pueden modificar para crear una variedad de<sb>comportamientos diferentes.<sb>Se crean varias capas de burbujas en un espacio de vista local en relación<sb>con el objeto, de modo que sean estables de fotograma en fotograma y<sb>siempre puedan moverse hacia arriba en relación con la gravedad.<sb>Los artistas pueden establecer una variedad de parámetros por líquido,<sb>como el color, el brillo, el potencial de espuma, las propiedades de las<sb>olas y un menisco en la superficie del licor que se enrolla alrededor de<sb>los bordes del volumen, lo que ayuda a comunicar la viscosidad del líquido.<sb>El ambiente refractado visto a través del vidrio y el líquido se muestra<sb>en el mismo mapa del entorno cúbico del área local que se utiliza para los<sb>reflejos, por lo que las botellas son efectivamente opacas y no tienen que<sb>mezclarse con el búfer del marco de la manera en que lo hacen normalmente<sb>los objetos transparentes.<sb>Esta fue una elección estratégica de diseño, ya que junto con el<sb>almacenamiento de los datos físicos en el color de tinta significa que las<sb>botellas se pueden representar juntas como un lote, en orden arbitrario,<sb>lo que es importante para el rendimiento gráfico.<sb>Al final, el efecto líquido refractivo permite que una variedad de<sb>interacciones tenga lugar en una fidelidad que es especialmente<sb>convincente con los controles manuales rastreados en realidad virtual.
Sabíamos por proyectos anteriores de realidad virtual que los jugadores<sb>esperarían un alto nivel de fidelidad de sus interacciones con objetos en<sb>el mundo, y durante las primeras pruebas de<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> recibimos<sb>comentarios de que los objetos no estaban haciendo los sonidos que los<sb>jugadores esperaban, dado el material, el tamaño y el peso asumido de un<sb>objeto.<sb>Esto nos llevó a un enfoque más granular de los sonidos físicos de lo que<sb>habíamos utilizado en productos anteriores.<sb>Por ejemplo, en el pasado, usamos un solo sonido físico para todos los<sb>objetos de cierto tamaño y material.<sb>Teníamos un sonido para representar colisiones de pequeños objetos<sb>metálicos, otro sonido para grandes objetos de madera, etc.<sb>Para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, creamos una nueva biblioteca de sonidos específicos<sb>de objetos para poder distinguir entre objetos similares, como una pieza<sb>de platería y una lata de metal pequeña.<sb>No solo ahora tenemos una biblioteca de casi dos mil sonidos físicos<sb>específicos de objetos que cubren más de 160 objetos diferentes, sino que<sb>también podemos alterar el sonido en tiempo de ejecución en función de la<sb>velocidad de impacto de un objeto y la dureza del material con el que<sb>colisiona.<sb>En algunos casos, incluso ponemos capas de sonidos que representan el<sb>contenido de un objeto, como fósforos en una caja de fósforos o<sb>combustible en un bidón, que se pueden escuchar cuando esos objetos son<sb>sacudidos por el jugador o chocan con algo a alta velocidad.
Traspasar la zona de cuarentena reveló un nuevo secreto oculto de la<sb>ciudad: la vida vegetal alienígena de Xen ha echado raíces en la Tierra y<sb>ha estado prosperando en las sombras de la Ciudad 17.<sb>En el equipo de desarrollo, el Hotel Estrella del Norte fue referido como<sb>"Hotel Xen" antes de que tuviera un nombre propio en la historia, ya que<sb>fue el primer lugar que usamos para explorar cómo podría verse la<sb>vegetación Xen y cómo podría consumir cualquier entorno dado.<sb>Uno de los retos a los que se enfrentó el equipo de medio ambiente al<sb>diseñar la vegetación Xen fue crear una nueva apariencia en un entorno<sb>existente sin tener que reconstruir versiones infestadas de Xen de cada<sb>elemento.<sb>Nos basamos en gran medida en la mezcla de texturas y elementos de<sb>vegetación Xen para manejar la mayoría de los grandes cambios ambientales<sb>cuando se xenifica una escena.<sb>También, añadimos algunas características nuevas a nuestro editor de<sb>nivel, Hammer, que permitieron una manipulación más creativa de los<sb>elementos para reducir la repetición.<sb>Por ejemplo, podíamos usar ciertos tipos de mallas como los tentáculos Xen.<sb>Podíamos colocarlos, escalarlos, estirarlos y manipularlos para serpentear<sb>a través de un entorno, lo que daría un aspecto artesanal sin que cada<sb>elemento tuviera que rehacerse para una ubicación específica.<sb>Estos elementos eran editables en Hammer para que pudieran ajustarse en<sb>cualquier momento, pero les incluimos mallas estáticas cuando compilamos<sb>el mapa para mejorar su rendimiento en tiempo de ejecución.
La flora Xen en esta área se anima en respuesta a la energía Vortigaunt<sb>pulsando desde la subestación de la Alianza en el exterior.<sb>Dado que la subestación en sí no es visible desde el interior del hotel,<sb>era importante que continuáramos recordando a los jugadores su presencia<sb>utilizando señales sonoras y visuales, y la flora Xen proporcionó una<sb>oportunidad perfecta para hacerlo.<sb>Los sombreadores utilizados en la flora Xen ayudan a ilustrar la respuesta<sb>de las plantas a los pulsos de energía de varias maneras diferentes.<sb>Por ejemplo, las vellosidades y los cilios se alargan y vibran, mientras<sb>que muchas de las otras plantas pulsan o brillan.<sb>La intensidad y el tiempo de estos efectos son impulsados directamente por<sb>el sistema de sonido, lo que significa que el refuerzo auditivo y visual<sb>de los pulsos de la subestación de la Alianza están siempre sincronizados.
El revividor, uno de los nuevos tipos de enemigos introducidos en<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, surgió de nuestra observación de que los jugadores de<sb>prueba disfrutaron buscando en su entorno en realidad virtual mucho más de<sb>lo que habían hecho en los juegos tradicionales.<sb>Además de recompensar ese deseo de buscar con municiones y resina,<sb>experimentamos con cómo podría ser parte de la batalla contra enemigos.<sb>Comenzamos a crear prototipos con una variante rápida de cangrejo que<sb>llamamos "corredores"; modificamos su comportamiento para que huyeran y se<sb>escondieran del jugador después de atacar.<sb>Descubrimos que los jugadores realmente disfrutaban buscando un pequeño<sb>enemigo oculto que sabían que estaba en algún lugar dentro de un denso<sb>entorno.<sb>También les gustaba disparar a un enemigo en movimiento rápido que podía<sb>correr debajo y detrás de objetos cotidianos, como mesas y sillas.<sb>Por último, los jugadores hablaron de que les gustaba la forma en que<sb>llegaron a ser el agresor en combate por una vez, ya que en cualquier otro<sb>lugar del juego se sentían como si siempre estuvieran a la defensiva.<sb>Si bien la interacción fue en general muy positiva, hubo un problema<sb>específico: cómo alentar a los jugadores a buscar al corredor.<sb>Después de algunos encuentros con corredores, descubrimos que los<sb>jugadores comenzaban a darse cuenta de que no tenían que buscar al<sb>corredor en absoluto, simplemente podían esperar a que huyera y luego<sb>salir de la habitación. Así que empezamos a crear prototipos de varias<sb>maneras en las que el corredor podría volverse más peligroso si no lo<sb>encontraban, estableciendo presión de tiempo donde los jugadores tuvieran<sb>que encontrar al corredor rápidamente, o la situación empeoraría.<sb>Después de un poco de experimentación, llegamos al prototipo donde el<sb>corredor podía revivir a un zombi caído, y convertirse en un nuevo tipo de<sb>enemigo, uno que era más peligroso que un corredor o zombi.<sb>Después de este cambio, rebautizamos al corredor internamente como<sb>"revividor", y comenzamos a ensamblar los diversos encuentros a su<sb>alrededor.<sb>Se necesitaron muchas pruebas de juego para balancear todos los diversos<sb>elementos de las peleas del revividor, porque involucran múltiples etapas<sb>separadas: combate contra el revividor, búsqueda de un revividor oculto y<sb>combate contra un zombi revivido.<sb>Al final, todavía no sentíamos que hubiéramos creado una razón<sb>suficientemente infalible para que los jugadores tuvieran que buscar<sb>revividores ocultos, por lo que convertimos el corazón del revividor en<sb>una llave, lo que requería que los jugadores la obtuvieran.
La animación de un enemigo puede provocar una poderosa respuesta emocional<sb>de los jugadores, especialmente en realidad virtual.<sb>Al desarrollar el revividor, aprendimos que a veces el desempeño de un<sb>personaje puede tener consecuencias no deseadas.<sb>En nuestros prototipos iniciales de revividor, simplemente usamos un<sb>modelo de cangrejo teñido de azul con efectos eléctricos rudimentarios.<sb>El prototipo tuvo suficiente éxito en las pruebas de juego que decidimos<sb>invertir en un nuevo modelo especialmente diseñado para el revividor, con<sb>piel eléctrica y efectos mejorados.<sb>Los jugadores identificaron el nuevo revividor con éxito en el juego, pero<sb>nos encontramos con un nuevo problema: los jugadores ya no querían luchar<sb>contra él.<sb>Si bien el cangrejo azul se identificó fácilmente como algo peligroso, el<sb>nuevo modelo fue algo que los jugadores tuvieron que evaluar desde cero y<sb>no necesariamente lo vieron como una amenaza.<sb>De hecho, las animaciones para el nuevo modelo del revividor fueron<sb>interpretadas por muchos jugadores como amistosas o incluso lindas.<sb>Los jugadores a menudo se acercaban a la criatura para tratar de<sb>acariciarla o, peor aún, se negaban a matarla para recuperar la pieza de<sb>acertijo requerida, lo que bloqueaba su progreso en el juego.<sb>Si entonces se dieron cuenta de que iban a tener que matar a la linda<sb>criatura para continuar, se sintieron horribles teniendo que seguir<sb>adelante con ello.<sb>Para solucionar esto, volvimos a programar la mayoría de las animaciones<sb>del revividor, las cuales lo hacen considerablemente más inquietante y<sb>amenazante.<sb>También hicimos que el revividor fuera más agresivo al agregarle un ataque<sb>de salto si el jugador se acercaba demasiado.<sb>Con estos cambios en la animación y el comportamiento, los jugadores una<sb>vez más peleaban contra el revividor según lo previsto y ya no querían<sb>llevarlo a casa como mascota.
Esta es la habitación que aparece en la primera toma del tráiler de<sb>anuncios de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>No es una opción obvia, para ese uso: la habitación es oscura, no<sb>particularmente colorida, y es un bonito pasillo peatonal.<sb>Los suministros de limpieza y las cestas de la ropa no son en sí mismos<sb>los que llaman la atención.<sb>Pero elegimos este escenario porque demuestra muy eficazmente la emoción y<sb>la tensión que pensamos que era típica del juego.<sb>Todos los tráilers de juegos requieren un diseño cuidadoso.<sb>Transmitir la experiencia central de un juego en tan solo unos momentos es<sb>complicado incluso en el mejor de los momentos.<sb>Pero creemos que, en el tráiler de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, tuvimos que<sb>esforzarnos más duro que la mayoría para enfrentar un conjunto de desafíos<sb>particularmente difíciles y poco comunes.<sb>Habíamos mantenido la existencia del juego en secreto, por lo que el<sb>estreno del tráiler iba a ser la primera vez en 13 años que Valve había<sb>mostrado cualquier avance en <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Además, el tráiler tuvo que comunicar rápidamente que Valve había elegido<sb>hacer de la próxima entrega de <I>Half-Life<I> un juego de realidad virtual.<sb>Y aunque teníamos mucha confianza en la decisión de hacer un juego de<sb>realidad virtual y en la calidad de lo que habíamos construido, todavía<sb>nos preocupaba que revelar esas decisiones al mundo pudiera hacer que<sb>incluso nuestros fans más leales tomaran su propia decisión: que realmente<sb>habíamos perdido la cabeza.<sb>Aquellos de nosotros que trabajamos en el tráiler, sabíamos que tenía que<sb>hacer que la gente estuviera tan emocionada que pudiera dejar de lado esas<sb>preocupaciones.<sb>El tráiler también tenía que transmitir claramente que el juego<sb><I>no era Half-Life 3<I>.<sb>Significa que no tenía lugar después de los eventos del Episodio 2.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> es, en cambio, una especie de precuela, que ocurre entre<sb>los eventos de <I>Half-Life<I> y <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Además, el tráiler tenía que mostrar profundidad, variedad, personajes<sb>familiares y suficiente novedad y sorpresa para llegar al espectador de<sb>que esta era realmente una entrega completa en la serie <I>Half-Life<I>, no un<sb>pequeño experimento de realidad virtual o "spinoff".<sb>Esta fue una tarea difícil, pero todo el equipo del juego se unió en torno<sb>al esfuerzo porque todos entendían el valor del trabajo.<sb>Estamos tan orgullosos del resultado que logramos en el tráiler como de<sb>cualquier otra parte de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.
<I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> admite tres tipos de movimiento del jugador.<sb>Movimiento continuo, teletransporte de cambio y uno repentino.<sb>Al principio, una de las propiedades del teletransporte repentino, y en<sb>menor grado, del teletransporte de cambio, era que los jugadores a menudo<sb>se referían a la mecánica del teletransporte al describir su movimiento a<sb>través del medio ambiente.<sb>"Me teletransporté al escritorio" o "me teletransporté a la portada" era a<sb>menudo cómo los jugadores describían sus acciones y servía como un<sb>recordatorio inconsciente de que estaban interactuando con un juego de una<sb>manera específica.<sb>Para abordar esto, hicimos un par de cambios clave desde el principio que<sb>alteraron considerablemente la forma en que los jugadores contaban su<sb>movimiento, y como resultado, los llevamos más hacia una realidad virtual<sb>más convincente.<sb>Uno de estos cambios fue el indicador visual que representaba el destino<sb>del teletransporte.<sb>Cambiamos el indicador cilíndrico abstracto usado en <I>The Lab<I> por un par de<sb>pies holográficos.<sb>Los pies ayudan a proporcionar una sensación de presencia física e<sb>indicaban la dirección a la que se enfrentaría el jugador al finalizar un<sb>teletransporte.<sb>También añadimos pies animados entre la ubicación actual del jugador y el<sb>objetivo de teletransportación.<sb>Estos pies ilustraban el camino que el jugador recorría, lo que ayudaba<sb>aún más a proporcionar una ficción para su movimiento a través del entorno.<sb>Junto con los cambios en la interfaz visual, también añadimos audio de<sb>pasos y movimientos corporales que se reproducirían después de un<sb>teletransporte para resumir de manera efectiva el movimiento del jugador a<sb>través del espacio.<sb>Esto no es algo que todos necesariamente noten al principio, pero es<sb>bastante obvio cuando falta o es incorrecto.<sb>El audio paso a paso transformó cómo los jugadores describían su<sb>movimiento a través del mundo y los jugadores a menudo se referían al<sb>movimiento en el entorno como caminar o correr en lugar de referirse a la<sb>terminología del juego.
En comparación con nuestras experiencias tradicionales en primera persona,<sb>en realidad virtual vimos que a veces era demasiado fácil crear un<sb>ambiente intenso.<sb>Esto se puede utilizar en beneficio del juego, pero también puede ser<sb>perjudicial en los casos en que nos centramos en entrenar a los jugadores<sb>en una nueva mecánica.<sb>En situaciones intensas, los jugadores con frecuencia no se dan cuenta o<sb>retienen información importante.<sb>Y como resultado, a menudo tuvimos que reducir intencionalmente la tensión<sb>en áreas del juego donde estábamos presentando a los jugadores algo nuevo.<sb>El audio del revividor aquí, a medida que el jugador desciende por debajo<sb>del hotel, está diseñado para facilitar a los jugadores la idea de que se<sb>encontrarán con la criatura que habían visto brevemente cuando entraron al<sb>hotel antes.<sb>El grito del revividor y su sombra en la pared están diseñados para<sb>reducir la tensión al indicar la posición del revividor a la vuelta de la<sb>esquina, lo que elimina cualquier posible sorpresa.<sb>Mostrar la posición del revividor y dar a los jugadores la ventaja ayuda a<sb>configurar la escena de resurrección, donde los jugadores quieren observar<sb>el revividor en lugar de dispararle inmediatamente.<sb>Esto es importante, porque esta es la primera vez que el jugador ve al<sb>revividor reanimando a un zombi, y si los jugadores están demasiado<sb>distraídos para asimilarlo, no tendrán éxito en la próxima pelea.
Uno de los desafíos con la mecánica de resurrección del revividor era<sb>entrenar a los jugadores que el revividor era el objetivo y el zombi era<sb>efectivamente solo un vehículo inerte que no podía dañarse.<sb>Esta fue una desviación considerable de lo que habíamos estado entrenando<sb>a los jugadores hasta entonces.<sb>Hasta este momento del juego, los jugadores veían a un zombi, le<sb>disparaban y siempre y cuando lo golpearan lo suficiente, moría.<sb>El revividor rompe esa expectativa y, en las primeras pruebas, los<sb>jugadores pensaron que el juego estaba fallando cuando el zombi no moriría<sb>o incluso ni reaccionaba a los disparos.<sb>Tuvimos que hacer una serie de cambios a zombis revividos para entrenar a<sb>los jugadores que este comportamiento era intencional.<sb>Primero, diseñamos la animación de introducción del zombi revivido para<sb>usar efectos de partículas y audio para llamar la atención sobre los<sb>cambios que resultan en este nuevo tipo de combate.<sb>En segundo lugar, sustituimos en partículas opacas y sonidos de impacto<sb>para hacer que disparar al zombi se sienta menos impactante que en<sb>encuentros anteriores con zombis ordinarios no revividos.<sb>Y, finalmente, modificamos el zombi revivido para que no reprodujera<sb>ninguna animación de aturdimiento ni responda a los impactos de bala, lo<sb>que además comunicaría a los jugadores que su comportamiento es diferente.<sb>También usamos el propio revividor para ilustrar la nueva experiencia de<sb>combate.<sb>Añadimos efectos eléctricos para indicar el movimiento del revividor<sb>dentro del zombi, con un brillante estallido y resplandor cuando emergía<sb>en una nueva ubicación en el cuerpo del zombi.<sb>Con estas nuevas imágenes y los satisfactorios sonidos de impacto y<sb>chillidos del revividor cuando eran golpeados, los jugadores ya no estaban<sb>confundidos y disfrutaban constantemente la nueva mecánica de combate.
En nuestros primeros diseños, un zombi revivido era solo un zombi<sb>invencible con un punto vulnerable en movimiento.<sb>Las pruebas de juego revelaron que esto era menos tenso y amenazante que<sb>el revividor por sí solo y como queríamos que el zombi revivido fuera un<sb>adversario de mayor riesgo, necesitábamos mejorar sus capacidades<sb>ofensivas.<sb>Como extensión natural de la naturaleza electrificada del revividor,<sb>elegimos crear un campo eléctrico alrededor del zombi revivido para que<sb>los jugadores que se acercaran demasiado sufrieran daño eléctrico grave.<sb>Esto funcionó bien para muchas pruebas de juego, hasta que observamos a un<sb>jugador que era un tirador competente en el mundo real.<sb>Este jugador fue capaz de derrotar fácilmente al zombi revivido sin ser<sb>amenazado por él.<sb>Como respuesta, le dimos al zombi revivido su contraataque terrestre<sb>electrificado, que obliga a los jugadores a cambiar de posición para<sb>evitar daño.<sb>Esto creó una cadencia de ataque y retiro que era más tensa y<sb>satisfactoria para todos los jugadores.
Dado que un juego de realidad virtual siempre debe representarse desde una<sb>cámara virtual que coincida con el punto de vista del jugador, tenemos<sb>oportunidades limitadas para controlar lo que el jugador ve.<sb>Los ascensores son una de las pocas herramientas que tenemos en realidad<sb>virtual para dirigir la vista del jugador.<sb>Un ascensor ascendente como este se puede utilizar de manera similar a una<sb>toma de grúa que se puede ver en la película, pasando de una elevación a<sb>otra, revelando una hermosa vista o un ritmo dramático de la historia.<sb>En la realidad virtual, los paseos en ascensor pueden ser difíciles de<sb>hacer cómodos, ya que el movimiento del ascensor virtual es inconsistente<sb>con el propio sistema vestibular del jugador.<sb>Descubrimos que podíamos hacer que los paseos en ascensor en<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> fueran lo suficientemente cómodos para la mayoría de los<sb>jugadores moviendo el elevador lentamente y limitando cuánto podía ver el<sb>jugador desde el ascensor.<sb>Este ascensor en particular estaba inicialmente mucho más abierto, pero<sb>gradualmente introdujimos más y más obstrucción visual en el diseño para<sb>que el jugador siempre tuviera una parte significativa del ascensor en su<sb>campo visual.<sb>Esto significó que pudimos obtener la revelación dramática del exterior<sb>del hotel y la subestación de la Alianza que deseábamos, pero los<sb>jugadores estaban cómodos ya que siempre podían ver el ascensor, que<sb>estaba en su propio marco de referencia.
Después de salir del ascensor, el jugador obtiene su vista más cercana de<sb>la subestación de la Alianza adjunta al exterior del hotel.<sb>Si bien la arquitectura la Alianza puede irse hacia lo abstracto, a menudo<sb>tiene más éxito cuando se contrasta con una estructura humana.<sb>Más allá de esto, siempre tratamos de impulsar el diseño visual con una<sb>función inventada, idealmente para apoyar el juego o la historia; en este<sb>caso, el enrutamiento de alguna fuente de energía inusual a la bóveda<sb>desde varias partes de la ciudad.<sb>El jugador no lo sabe en este momento, pero esta subestación está diseñada<sb>para esencialmente torturar a un grupo de Vortigaunts que están alojados<sb>en las granjas de cápsulas adjuntas.<sb>La salida se recoge de los Vortigaunts antes de ser "rearmonizada" por un<sb>solo Vortigaunt "conductor" a través del aparato sintonizador de cables<sb>visto en la raíz de los cables de transmisión que corren hasta la propia<sb>bóveda.<sb>Este diseño nos dio la oportunidad de conocer posteriormente a otro<sb>Vortigaunt, y actuó como una restricción suficiente para permitirnos<sb>diseñar una interacción que comprometiera físicamente la subestación a<sb>medida que el jugador sale del hotel en el siguiente mapa.
La vegetación Xen se diseñó para responder al jugador de varias maneras.<sb>En las zonas oscuras, donde la linterna está activa, parte de la flora Xen<sb>se animará o se expandirá en respuesta a la luz.<sb>Estas plantas Xen responden a la proximidad de la mano del jugador al<sb>brillar y pulsar.<sb>El efecto de brillo en particular se representa con un desplazamiento<sb>utilizando la perspectiva binocular correcta para cada ojo, lo que da la<sb>impresión de que el brillo se origina en el interior del organismo.<sb>Los efectos de sombreado de la flora Xen que dependen de la proximidad de<sb>la mano toman su entrada de un campo de voxel dinámico que sigue al<sb>jugador en todo momento.<sb>Las manos del jugador dibujan senderos de movimiento en este campo de<sb>voxels, que pueden ser muestreados por los sombreadores de la vegetación<sb>para impulsar deformaciones y otros efectos de sombreado.<sb>Si el jugador mueve sus manos rápidamente, producen rastros de movimiento<sb>en el campo de voxel.<sb>Si mantienen las manos quietas, producen una fuerza radiante.<sb>Estos diferentes tipos de características de movimiento nos permiten crear<sb>diferentes comportamientos en la vegetación para darle un poco de<sb>personalidad adicional.
Los efectos de partículas presentan un desafío interesante en la realidad<sb>virtual debido a la estereopsis, que es nuestra capacidad para discernir<sb>la profundidad de los objetos desde dos vistas ligeramente diferentes del<sb>mundo que vemos desde nuestros dos ojos.<sb>Los sistemas de partículas tradicionales, como se ve a la izquierda, se<sb>implementaron típicamente como una serie de imágenes mostradas en<sb>polígonos relativamente grandes que se orientan hacia el jugador.<sb>Cada serie de imágenes contendría efectivamente una pequeña película de un<sb>fenómeno más complejo como una bocanada de humo, o una llama parpadeante,<sb>etc.<sb>Para el renderizado monoscópico utilizado en sistemas que no son de<sb>realidad virtual, este enfoque es bueno y se utiliza ampliamente en toda<sb>la industria.<sb>Sin embargo, debido a la representación estéreo utilizada en realidad<sb>virtual, los jugadores pueden ver fácilmente las cartas planas, lo que<sb>resulta en el efecto poco convincente visto a la izquierda.<sb>Para abordar esto, tuvimos que actualizar nuestras técnicas de renderizado<sb>de partículas para realidad virtual.<sb>El sistema de partículas a la derecha es una versión actualizada<sb>compatible con la realidad virtual del efecto viejo visto a la izquierda.<sb>Una técnica que usamos en cartas grandes como las usadas en este efecto de<sb>humo fue crear un poco de arrastre en la reacción de las cartas al<sb>movimiento de la cabeza del jugador.<sb>Para hacerlo, creamos otro sistema de partículas que se atrasa en la<sb>posición del jugador y se usa como la cámara del jugador para la dirección<sb>a la que ve las cartas de humo.<sb>Al eliminar esta relación uno a uno del movimiento de la cabeza con la<sb>rotación del sprite, pudimos dar la impresión de que el humo era<sb>volumétrico.<sb>Además de utilizar más elementos 3D en la creación de nuestros efectos, a<sb>menudo también utilizamos una floración posterior al procesamiento en<sb>partículas para ayudar a fusionar visualmente elementos que de otro modo<sb>aparecerían como un conjunto de planos.<sb>Esto hizo que las tarjetas fueran más difíciles de fusionar estéreo, lo<sb>que les dio una sensación más difusa y volumétrica.
Uno de los principios del diseño del juego <I>Half-Life<I> es crear experiencias<sb>elaboradas momento a momento en las que los jugadores participen a medida<sb>que avanzan en el juego.<sb>A veces, esto significa jugar con respuestas emocionales para convertir<sb>algo indeseable en un punto culminante memorable.<sb>Esta sección colapsada del hotel cuenta con este tipo de experiencia.<sb>A menudo, los jugadores llegan de forma instintiva al lugar de apariencia<sb>más segura en un área determinada, y aquí ese es el corredor bien<sb>iluminado de arriba.<sb>Pero, cuando llegan allí, encuentran su camino bloqueado por un escudo de<sb>poder de la Alianza.<sb>El cable de alimentación para apagar el campo de fuerza la Alianza los<sb>lleva de vuelta a la oscuridad infestada de cangrejos venenosos de abajo.<sb>Un lugar al que realmente no quieres ir.<sb>Estos espacios de juego más grandes también deben ser resistentes a la<sb>elección del jugador.<sb>Así que incluso si un jugador elige no dirigirse al pasillo bien<sb>iluminado, es probable que todavía tengan la misma inquietud acerca de<sb>dirigirse a la oscuridad de abajo.<sb>Después de que el jugador haya desafiado la oscuridad y se haya refugiado<sb>en la sala iluminada donde están a salvo de los cangrejos errantes, se<sb>enfrentan a la desalentadora tarea de cortar la energía del campo de<sb>fuerza la Alianza, porque esto tiene el efecto secundario de sumergir el<sb>área en la oscuridad.<sb>Eso no solo empeora la situación, ya que el jugador debe salir de la<sb>oscuridad del campo con solo una linterna, sino que el camino hacia la<sb>salida está de vuelta a través de todos los cangrejos venenosos.<sb>Pasamos mucho tiempo sintonizando esta experiencia a través de cuidadosas<sb>pruebas de juego y evaluación.<sb>Y, a menudo, al contar sus viajes a través del hotel en discusiones tras<sb>las pruebas, los jugadores recordaban este momento de sumergirse en la<sb>oscuridad como un punto importante que lograba combinar una sensación de<sb>diversión con una general de temor.
Un problema común del diseño de juegos es el de la colocación de recursos,<sb>y este lugar en el juego es un buen ejemplo.<sb>Los jugadores acaban de salir de un área donde adquirieron el subfusil de<sb>la Alianza.<sb>Cada vez que consiguen un arma nueva, intentamos darle al jugador la<sb>oportunidad de experimentar con ella ahora mismo.<sb>Así que, justo después del subfusil, nos aseguramos de darle al jugador un<sb>montón de municiones, y un suministro de enemigos no demasiado<sb>amenazantes, en forma de zombis confinados y cangrejos vagabundos, para<sb>experimentar.<sb>Pero las pruebas de juego nos han demostrado que hay una amplia gama de<sb>formas en que los jugadores responden a esa configuración.<sb>Algunos disparan a un cangrejo o dos y siguen adelante, mientras que otros<sb>se toman su tiempo explorando el arma, incluso usando toda la munición que<sb>les dimos.<sb>Ahora, después de los cangrejos, el jugador se dirige hacia una nueva<sb>área, que cuenta con una de las arenas de combate más difíciles del juego,<sb>donde deben luchar contra dos revividores al mismo tiempo.<sb>¿Cuánta munición podemos esperar que el jugador tenga aquí? ¿Cuánto<sb>debemos poner en esta área entre las dos arenas para garantizar que todos<sb>los jugadores tengan suficiente para pelear contra los dos revividores? Si<sb>no ponemos lo suficiente, un jugador puede estar en una posición en la que<sb>no puede tener éxito en el próximo encuentro, y recargar sus partidas<sb>guardadas no ayudará.<sb>Tendrían que volver y volver a jugar el área anterior, esta vez<sb>conservando más munición.<sb>Eso no es algo que queramos que suceda, ni es algo que podamos esperar que<sb>todos los jugadores se den cuenta.<sb>En cambio, muchos intentarán repetidamente y fallarán al vencer a los dos<sb>revividores.<sb>Así que, en esencia, el problema con la colocación de recursos es que el<sb>rango dinámico de recursos que llevan los jugadores puede ser<sb>considerable, y se amplía aún más a medida que avanza el juego.<sb>En <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, vimos a algunos jugadores terminar el juego apenas con<sb>algunas municiones, mientras que otros jugadores tenían más de 1000<sb>proyectiles sin usar.
Entonces, ¿cómo podemos manejar la colocación de recursos cuando hay un<sb>rango dinámico tan amplio en la colección de jugadores y los patrones de uso?<sb>Al igual que muchos juegos, optamos por un sistema dinámico que mira<sb>los recuentos de recursos actuales del jugador y toma decisiones basadas<sb>en ellos.<sb>Pero el diseño de este tipo de sistemas puede ser complicado porque<sb>tienden a afectar el comportamiento del jugador.<sb>Por ejemplo, en <I>Half-Life 2<I>, colocamos cajas rompibles a lo largo del<sb>juego que generaron recursos dinámicamente basados
en los niveles<sb>actuales de vida y munición del jugador.<sb>Esto tenía la ventaja de permitirnos no necesitar una gran cantidad de<sb>pruebas de juego para equilibrar los recursos, porque siempre y cuando<sb>hubiera suficientes cajas alrededor, el jugador siempre tendría<sb>suficientes recursos.<sb>Pero debido a que ese sistema existe, no tuvimos que pasar mucho tiempo en<sb>la colocación de recursos, y como resultado, realmente no creamos desafíos<sb>en torno a la recopilación de recursos.<sb>Los jugadores también aprendieron que no necesitaban preocuparse realmente<sb>por sus niveles de recursos, porque las cajas siempre iban a recargarlas<sb>en lo que más necesitaban.<sb>Para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, queríamos revisar esas suposiciones.<sb>Sabíamos que la búsqueda de recursos en un entorno de realidad virtual era<sb>algo que los jugadores realmente disfrutaban.<sb>Así que queríamos que la colección de recursos fuera algo que los<sb>jugadores tuvieran que hacer durante todo el juego.<sb>Y eso significaba que no queríamos que llegaran al punto en que tuvieran<sb>tanta munición y vida que no tuvieran que explorar.<sb>También pudimos comenzar las pruebas de juego más temprano en el ciclo de<sb>desarrollo del producto que cuando hicimos<cr><I>Half-Life 2<I>, lo que nos dio la<sb>confianza de que podríamos pasar el tiempo que necesitábamos para colocar<sb>cuidadosamente cada recurso.
Para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, pasamos a un sistema que nos permitió crear una<sb>experiencia más específica, utilizando una capa dinámica que intenta<sb>reducir el rango dinámico de recopilación de recursos entre jugadores.
<sb>En lugar de colocar recursos genéricos que cambian de tipo, los diseñadores<sb>de nivel colocaron cuidadosamente cada tipo de recurso en todo el mundo.<sb>Algunos son fáciles de encontrar, y otros, más difíciles.<sb>Luego, a medida que el jugador avanza en el mundo, el sistema elimina de<sb>forma oportunista los recursos en el camino a seguir, en función de los<sb>niveles de recursos actuales del jugador.<sb>Esto tuvo el beneficio de permitir a los diseñadores de nivel tener un<sb>gran control sobre las cantidades de recursos del jugador en diferentes<sb>áreas del juego.<sb>Pudieron crear áreas donde querían que el jugador se muriera de hambre de<sb>un tipo de munición, o alentado a usar otro.<sb>Por ejemplo, en esta área, los diseñadores podrían proporcionar suficiente<sb>munición para garantizar que el jugador tuviera suficiente para pelear<sb>contra dos revividores, con el conocimiento de que el sistema de<sb>equilibrio de municiones eliminaría gran parte de ella si el jugador ya<sb>estaba cargado.<sb>Podríamos darles a los jugadores una gran cantidad de munición la Alianza<sb>para el subfusil en el área anterior y saber que los jugadores que pasaron<sb>por delante de los cangrejos venenosos sin disparar un tiro no<sb>encontrarían más aquí.<sb>Hay una serie de características adicionales para abordar las<sb>complejidades que resultan de este sistema, como asegurarse de que los<sb>jugadores siempre encuentren algo dentro de un casillero de la Alianza, o<sb>asegurarse de que los jugadores aún sean recompensados por buscar con<sb>regularidad y cuidado, incluso si llevan una gran cantidad de munición.<sb>En última instancia, queremos que un jugador que esté prestando más<sb>atención al medio ambiente tenga más recursos.<sb>Solo necesitábamos algunos diales para poder controlar<sb>qué tan adelante estaban.
Hasta este punto, cada encuentro de revividor se ha centrado en enseñar a<sb>los jugadores algo nuevo sobre el revividor para que puedan derrotarlo.<sb>Esta arena representa la culminación de ese entrenamiento.<sb>No hay reglas nuevas.<sb>No hay nada que aprender sobre el mismo revividor.<sb>En este punto, los jugadores están armados con el conocimiento necesario<sb>para progresar.<sb>El desafío entonces se convierte en un problema de combate donde se<sb>requieren estrategia y ejecución.<sb>Los jugadores tienen que maniobrar y priorizar múltiples objetivos,<sb>utilizar todas sus armas y administrar un suministro limitado de<sb>municiones para prevalecer y regresar al exterior del hotel para poder<sb>desactivar la subestación de la Alianza.
Una de las subhistorias centrales es con respecto al encarcelamiento de la<sb>Alianza y el uso de los Vortigaunts<cr>para atrapar a G-Man.<sb>El poder multidimensional de los Vortigaunts para detener al G-man<sb>aparentemente invencible se establece en la historia previa de <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Mediante el uso de sus cápsulas prisioneras y tecnología de subestación,<sb>la Alianza extrae el poder del canto de vortesencia del Vortigaunt,<sb>sintoniza esa energía y luego la transmite a la bóveda para contener al<sb>G-man.<sb>Para comunicar este proceso de la Alianza al jugador sin explicarlo a<sb>través de una larga exposición, utilizamos patrones de sonido musical para<sb>representar el proceso implícitamente.<sb>Si te paras cerca de las cápsulas que sostienen los Vortigaunts, puedes<sb>oírlos gemir su canto en un patrón lento pero semimusical.<sb><wait:9>Justo más allá de las cápsulas está el "resonador" dentro del cual puedes<sb>escuchar una versión destilada de la energía del canto.<sb><wait:16>Finalmente, los cables se activan con la energía Vortigaunt concentrada,<sb>que se armoniza en patrones variables y se transmite intermitentemente a<sb>la bóveda una vez que la energía está suficientemente sintonizada.<sb>Si te paras cerca de los cables mientras están sintonizados, notarás el<sb>tamaño y la altura del sonido.<sb>Logramos esto colocando los emisores de sonido para cada cable en las<sb>ubicaciones de los cables reales.<sb>El sonido de los cables cubre una amplia gama de frecuencias que enfatiza<sb>el procesamiento de la "función de transferencia relacionada<sb>con la cabeza" de Steam Audio.<sb>Esa simulación combinada con la retroalimentación del oído interno de los<sb>observadores mientras mira hacia arriba da la misma impresión de escala<sb>que la realidad virtual es conocida por dar objetos visuales.<sb><wait:17>
El rendimiento del personaje dentro de un juego de realidad virtual tiene<sb>un conjunto único de oportunidades y desafíos.<sb>En nuestros esfuerzos por mantener el control en las manos del jugador,<sb>debemos crear un rendimiento que sea lo suficiente interesante como para<sb>mantener la atención de los jugadores, pero lo suficiente flexible como<sb>para permitir la libertad del jugador.<sb>Esta escena tiene la interacción más cara a cara en el juego y no hay<sb>barrera física entre el jugador y el Vortigaunt cuando aparece por primera<sb>vez.<sb>En un momento dado, jugamos con la idea de un susto de salto cuando se<sb>lanza el Vortigaunt, lo que supera las expectativas del jugador de lo que<sb>se había referido solo como una "batería" hasta ese momento.<sb>No solo era abrupto, pero el Vortigaunt llegaba agitándose fuera de la<sb>cápsula con frecuencia en el mismo espacio ocupado por el jugador.<sb>Para resolver este problema, cortamos el susto del salto y movimos la<sb>cápsula fuera del espacio del jugador mientras se abría para permitir que<sb>el Vortigaunt emergiera a una buena distancia.<sb>Nos enfrentamos a un desafío similar al determinar cómo llevar tanto al<sb>jugador como a Vortigaunt a sus próximas ubicaciones sin intersección.<sb>Queríamos que el jugador y el Vortigaunt se asomaran a la vista mientras<sb>el Vortigaunt ofrecía una exposición importante.<sb>Habría sido incómodo para el jugador y el Vortigaunt tomar la misma ruta a<sb>lo largo de la pasarela, por lo que analizamos otras opciones, incluida la<sb>exploración de formas en que el Vortigaunt pudo haberse movido una vez en<sb>su entorno nativo.<sb>Con los antebrazos largos, es factible que los Vortigaunts se hayan movido<sb>como cuadrúpedos, así que elegimos una ágil revuelta de cuatro patas hasta<sb>la plataforma superior donde puede entregar la exposición sin competir con<sb>el jugador por espacio.
Mientras desarrollábamos <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, había un gran número de personas<sb>en muchas disciplinas que contribuían a un número relativamente pequeño de<sb>mapas.<sb>Esto significaba que con frecuencia teníamos varias personas trabajando en<sb>el mismo mapa al mismo tiempo.<sb>Una forma en que manejamos esta complejidad fue dividir nuestros mapas en<sb>pedazos más pequeños conocidos como "prefabs". Un prefab puede construirse<sb>a partir de los mismos tipos de geometría, lógica, enemigos, sistemas de<sb>partículas o cualquier otro elemento que un mapa regular.<sb>Mientras las personas estuvieran trabajando en prefabs separados, podrían<sb>hacer cambios o adiciones sin interferir en el trabajo del otro.<sb>Un prefab puede contener un gran espacio físico como toda esta escena<sb>callejera o podría contener solo un puñado de elementos.<sb>Los prefabs grandes que particionaron un mapa para permitir la<sb>colaboración fueron esenciales para un proyecto de esta gama, pero también<sb>creamos muchos prefabs pequeños y reutilizables para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Un buen ejemplo de esto fue el conjunto de prefabs de vehículos<sb>reutilizables utilizados aquí y durante el juego.<sb>Creamos cada vehículo como un prefab configurable, lo que permitió a los<sb>diseñadores colocarlos rápidamente alrededor del juego estableciendo<sb>algunos parámetros para personalizar el vehículo para el contexto.<sb>Los parámetros incluyen puntos como el color de la pintura del vehículo,<sb>la cantidad de daño preexistente, si las puertas estaban abiertas o<sb>simplemente faltaban y el tipo de munición u otros recursos que el<sb>vehículo podría contener.<sb>Esto aceleró nuestro flujo de trabajo y también significó que las<sb>actualizaciones a un prefab se propagaron automáticamente a todos los<sb>mapas que la utilizaron.
Las lonas utilizadas por la Alianza para cubrir edificios en la zona de<sb>cuarentena se generan de forma aleatoria.<sb>Esta animación se agregó relativamente tarde en el desarrollo, por lo que<sb>necesitaba ser tanto computacionalmente barata como tecnológicamente<sb>conservadora.<sb>Así que no hay nuevos sistemas.<sb>Las formas de onda solapadas simples sirven para desplazar la geometría de<sb>la lona donde cuelga libremente del edificio.<sb>Los desplazamientos están orientados a lo largo de la dirección del<sb>viento, y su dirección de propagación se modifica aún más por los<sb>gradientes de una textura a la que nos referimos como un mapa de "libertad<sb>de movimiento".<sb>Este mapa se deriva de la forma de la geometría del edificio debajo de la<sb>lona y se utiliza para atenuar el desplazamiento de modo que la lona no se<sb>anime en lugares donde se pretende tirar firmemente contra el edificio.<sb>El resultado es una lona que aletea que parece ajustarse a su entorno y<sb>responde adecuadamente al viento.
El soldado la Alianza que ves aquí no peleará contigo.<sb>Se programó para correr de ida y vuelta por el camino que se muestra en el<sb>suelo, con el fin de ilustrar el sistema de reorientación de zancada<sb>desarrollado para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Uno de los desafíos de animar a los personajes digitales es asegurarse de<sb>que sus pies no se deslicen por el suelo a medida que se mueven.<sb>Los humanos son muy buenos para detectar irregularidades en los<sb>movimientos de personajes virtuales, especialmente en realidad virtual, y<sb>los soldados de la Alianza en particular necesitan parecer que sus pies<sb>están plantando y su peso está cambiando a medida que cambian de<sb>dirección, de lo contrario parecen ingrávidos y poco convincentes.<sb>En una fase de preprocesamiento, nuestro sistema de reorientación de<sb>zancada analiza los pasos de cada animación y los almacena como una<sb>trayectoria independiente de la dirección.<sb>En tiempo de ejecución, nuestro sistema predice dónde aterrizará cada pie<sb>en el siguiente paso basado en el movimiento de la animación, el camino<sb>del personaje y la altura del suelo.<sb>Los pares de cajas de colores en el suelo ilustran este proceso.<sb>Las casillas rojas muestran las posiciones anteriores del pie.<sb>Las casillas verdes indican la posición actual del pie del soldado y las<sb>casillas azules se dibujan donde se predice que cada pie aterrizará a<sb>continuación.<sb>Una vez que se calculan las posiciones pronosticadas del pie, el sistema<sb>guía los pies a las ubicaciones pronosticadas utilizando la información de<sb>trayectoria para preservar el estilo de la animación original.<sb>Una vez que el pie aterriza, se bloquea en su lugar hasta el siguiente<sb>paso.<sb>Al final, este sistema fue tan efectivo que esencialmente pudimos hacer<sb>que cualquier animación caminara en cualquier dirección, sin deslizamiento<sb>del pie.<sb>Puedes experimentar con el sistema moviéndote por el área, ya que este<sb>soldado está configurado para verte siempre mientras se ejecuta la ruta<sb>especificada.
Las minas de proximidad han aparecido en juegos anteriores de <I>Half-Life<I> y<sb>el acto de desactivarlas parecía un ajuste natural para un juego de<sb>realidad virtual, donde los jugadores pueden realizar operaciones<sb>complejas con sus manos.<sb>En este momento del juego, los jugadores ya han aprendido a hackear la<sb>tecnología la Alianza con su multiherramienta, pero queríamos que hubiera<sb>una actividad de desactivar una mina de proximidad para darles más tensión<sb>los acertijos de hackeo.<sb>Para desactivar una mina de proximidad, el jugador no solo tiene que<sb>colocar su mano cerca del láser que podría activar la mina, sino que tiene<sb>que realizar la tarea en solo unos segundos.<sb>Las primeras versiones de este acertijo se inspiraron en la selección de<sb>cerraduras, que se asemejaban a una serie de interruptores que el jugador<sb>tenía que alinear rápidamente.<sb>Desafortunadamente, el diseño de interruptores requería que los jugadores<sb>rotaran sus muñecas de una manera incómoda, particularmente dado que<sb>también tenían que evitar tocar el rayo láser.<sb>Eliminamos el componente de rotación, pero mantuvimos el elemento de<sb>tiempo, lo que llevó a la mecánica que ves en el juego final.<sb>También experimentamos con hacer que las minas de proximidad explotaran si<sb>el jugador no las desactivaba, pero la mayoría de los jugadores pensaron<sb>que esto era demasiado rudo, especialmente en los casos en los que podría<sb>ocurrir una reacción en cadena de explosiones.<sb>En cambio, las minas simplemente permanecen activas y el jugador puede<sb>intentar desactivarlas de nuevo.<sb>Terminamos manteniendo este comportamiento para el ajuste de dificultad<sb>difícil, pero añadimos un sonido de advertencia unos segundos antes de que<sb>la mina realmente explote para dar a los jugadores tiempo para alejarse.<sb>También experimentamos con permitir que las minas desactivadas fueran<sb>removidas y redesplegadas por el jugador, pero no habíamos diseñado<sb>suficientes escenarios de combate alrededor de esta mecánica para que<sb>fuera satisfactorio en la práctica, por lo que esto quedó fuera del juego<sb>final.
Esta arena de combate que se vuelve sobre sí misma mientras el jugador<sb>pasa por los edificios de la propiedad fue parte de uno de los primeros<sb>mapas de prueba construidos cuando comenzamos a agregar soldados de la<sb>Alianza a <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Una de las lecciones que aprendimos de esta serie de encuentros de combate<sb>fue que los soldados combatientes de la Alianza gravaban físicamente a los<sb>jugadores, ya que necesitábamos prestar atención cuidadosa al ritmo.<sb>Cubrirse, recargar, cambiar armas y adquirir objetivos; realmente probó al<sb>límite todas las habilidades que los jugadores habían<sb>aprendido hasta este momento.<sb>Para ayudar a reducir la fatiga, agregamos brechas entre los encuentros de<sb>la Alianza y eliminamos parte del combate por completo para mejorar el<sb>ritmo de la experiencia.<sb>Las minas de proximidad en la escalera después de esta batalla son un buen<sb>ejemplo de uno de los elementos de estimulación que usamos para ralentizar<sb>al jugador y dejarlo recuperarse antes de que las rampas de combate<sb>vuelvan a subir.
Fue un desafío interesante para los artistas y diseñadores de nivel<sb>emplear la narración ambiental para pintar un cuadro de lo que pudo haber<sb>sucedido dentro de las paredes de la zona de cuarentena.<sb>Al igual que el hotel, estos apartamentos fueron invadidos por vegetación<sb>Xen y están llenos de pertenencias de la gente, que las dejaron a toda<sb>prisa.<sb>En esta área, las paredes están derribadas, ya sea por las tormentas<sb>destructivas del portal o quizás por el esfuerzo de limpieza de la Alianza.<sb>Los barriles de fluido utilizados por los trabajadores para tratar o<sb>contener el crecimiento de Xen quedaron atrás y parece que los esfuerzos<sb>de limpieza fracasaron o fueron abandonados.<sb>Al no explicar todas las facetas del mundo, dejamos a los jugadores la<sb>oportunidad de imaginar por sí mismos el panorama más amplio de la vida en<sb>la Ciudad 17.
Una vez que completamos el núcleo del juego, los equipos revisaron los<sb>mapas en busca de oportunidades adicionales para agregar el carácter y el<sb>tono que los jugadores asocian con los juegos de <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Este cangrejo maniquí fue una oportunidad divertida para explorar el<sb>ambiente de ciencia ficción/terror/cine B.<sb>Tuvimos algunas conversaciones sobre cuánto tiempo dejar el cangrejo<sb>encima del maniquí, y decidimos que la experiencia debería ser análoga a<sb>atrapar a un perro pequeño en medio de alguna travesura.<sb>Queríamos que los jugadores sintieran que habían entrado en algo que no se<sb>suponía que vieran, y que se fueran sintiendo como si cada centímetro del<sb>juego contuviera algo que pudieran encontrar, si decidían explorarlo.<sb>Después de una actualización temprana de los sonidos del cangrejo, donde<sb>agregamos detalles como la respiración y los gruñidos por primera vez,<sb>recibimos comentarios de que los nuevos sonidos eran demasiado lindos y<sb>familiares, lo que llevó al cangrejo demasiado lejos, como una tierna<sb>criatura en lugar de una amenaza alienígena.<sb>Actualizamos los sonidos para que fueran más amenazantes, pero para este<sb>cangrejo trajimos algunos de los sonidos más lindos para convencer la<sb>frustración del cangrejo con el maniquí.
Para reducir la cantidad de recarga necesaria en la batalla,<sb>queríamos que los jugadores pudieran mejorar su pistola al aumentar su capacidad de munición.<sb>Esto podría parecer un cambio pequeño, pero lo implementamos para que fuera intuitivo para ellos,<sb>y hacer que no tuviera muchos efectos negativos<sb>fue algo bastante difícil de conseguir.<sb>Nuestra mecánica inicial para aumentar la capacidad de munición de la pistola fue usar cartuchos más grandes.<sb>Al mejorar la pistola, la mochila del jugador tenía el doble de balas<sb>y estaban representadas con un modelo de cartucho que era el doble de largo.<sb>Lamentablemente, los cartuchos largos presentaban muchos problemas ficcionales de distracción.<sb>Para empezar, se veían ridículos porque sobresalían del borde de la pistola.<sb>Los jugadores se cuestionaban lo que pasaba en sus mochilas,<sb>los cartuchos normales que colocaban allí<sb>salían como versiones de doble capacidad.<sb>También, vimos un tipo de implicación absurda cuando los cartuchos encontrados en el mundo<sb>se volvían mágicamente versiones actualizadas de doble tamaño.<sb>Aunque desechamos los cartuchos con el doble de tamaño,<sb>el concepto seguía siendo interesante. Solo debíamos encontrar una mejor metáfora.<sb>Así que comenzamos a buscar en las tolvas que se utilizan en las armas de paintball<sb>que pueden almacenar una gran cantidad de bolas de pintura.<sb>De hecho, la mejora final fue el resultado de todas estas ideas<sb>que a nivel interno se conocen como tolva de balas.<sb>Con esto en mente, necesitábamos un diseño y un modelo de interacción intuitivos.<sb>La mayoría ya estaba satisfecha con nuestro bucle de interacción de pistolas que era:<sb>sacar cartucho, insertar el nuevo, recámara y disparar,<sb>así que quisimos mantener esas habilidades para todos los que estaban comenzando a dominarlas.<sb>Así, los jugadores podían seguir recargando el arma, pero las pequeñas puntas metálicas<sb>robaban balas del cartucho insertado, la colocaban en la tolva<sb>y luego las llevaban a la recámara para dispararlas.<sb>También, añadimos pistas de audio para comunicar claramente el estado del proceso de carga de la tolva.<sb>La tolva también impactaba el diseño visual que usamos para transmitir el estado de la pistola.<sb>Originalmente los cartuchos tenían un contador numérico que indicaba la cantidad<sb>de balas que quedaban, algo que estaba bien y que todos entendían con facilidad.<sb>Pero la lectura de la tolva de balas estaba en dirección opuesta a la pistola<sb>y tenía un patrón de puntos azules que indicaban la cantidad de balas que quedaban.<sb>Así que estas dos representaciones en dos lugares distintos<sb>dificultaba comprender el número total de balas en la pistola mejorada.<sb>Para resolver esto, diseñamos una única lectura visual en el lado de la empuñadora de la pistola.<sb>A nivel estructural, concordaba con el estado del cartucho de la pistola,<sb>la recámara de la pistola y la tolva si se adquiría la mejora.
Para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, queríamos ampliar la funcionalidad de nuestro<sb>sistema de paisaje sonoro que se utiliza para reproducir sonidos<sb>ambientales.<sb>En juegos anteriores, generalmente solo podíamos reproducir un sonido<sb>ambiental a la vez.<sb>El jugador puede tener el sonido ambiental "A" o el "B" con un breve<sb>fundido cruzado de uno a otro.<sb>En este juego, los sonidos ambientales son mucho más flexibles y se pueden<sb>superponer de manera que permitan transiciones más realistas.<sb>Por ejemplo, el volumen de diferentes sonidos ambientales puede ser<sb>controlado por la posición del jugador y el estado abierto o cerrado de<sb>determinadas puertas en el mundo.<sb>Con frecuencia usamos esta funcionalidad en áreas como esta transición<sb>entre espacios interiores y exteriores.<sb>Si haces una pausa afuera por un momento, notarás grillos, pájaros,<sb>ladridos de perros distantes y otros sonidos ambientales que ayudan a<sb>transmitir la imagen de la zona de cuarentena al final del día.<sb>A medida que te mueves hacia el interior, notarás que el sonido ambiental<sb>exterior disminuye a medida que te alejas de la puerta.<sb>De hecho, si cierras la puerta, el volumen del sonido ambiental al aire<sb>libre se reduce aún más.<sb>Y a medida que avanzas hacia el edificio, comenzarás a notar el sonido<sb>ambiental interior, que consiste en el zumbido indistinto de la maquinaria<sb>y el zumbido de los accesorios eléctricos.
Por lo general, es un requisito que todos los nuevos tipos de enemigos<sb>tengan una sección del juego diseñada para introducirlos.<sb>Sin embargo, rara vez construimos la introducción al principio del<sb>proceso, porque a menudo es a través de las pruebas de juego que<sb>aprendemos exactamente qué aspectos del nuevo enemigo deben destacarse en<sb>la introducción.<sb>Además de comprender las capacidades de un nuevo enemigo, también<sb>encontramos introducciones que ayudan a solidificar la existencia misma<sb>del nuevo tipo de enemigo en la mente del jugador.<sb>Sin una introducción explícita, a veces encontramos que los jugadores de<sb>prueba confunden múltiples tipos de enemigos; los llegan a confundir.<sb>Este fue el caso del supresor, la clase de soldado que está diseñada para<sb>poner a un jugador a cubierto mientras otros soldados avanzan sobre ellos.<sb>El supresor es una inversión de las clases de soldados anteriores, que se<sb>han centrado en tratar de sacar a los jugadores de la cobertura.<sb>La introducción del supresor se extiende a lo largo de las dos salas<sb>siguientes.<sb>En el primero, los jugadores ven al supresor disparando a zombis, lo que<sb>da un momento para observar con seguridad su comportamiento de disparo.<sb>También pueden escuchar sus sonidos asociados, que son importantes de<sb>aprender para futuros encuentros.<sb>En la segunda sala, los jugadores aprenden a pelear contra el supresor<sb>ellos mismos.<sb>Esto es relativamente sencillo cuando el supresor está solo, pero se<sb>involucrará más en escenarios posteriores, donde combinamos al supresor<sb>con otros tipos de soldados.
No es práctico gastar tiempo de desarrollo o recursos artísticos<sb>uniformemente en todas las partes del juego, por lo que confiamos en la<sb>reutilización estratégica de los recursos para mantener la fidelidad y la<sb>especificidad en los entornos de un juego.<sb>Este espacio se construyó inicialmente utilizando modelos industriales y<sb>texturas vistas en muchos entornos anteriores.<sb>Para diferenciarlo, añadimos los grandes cables y las cápsulas de<sb>Vortigaunt para implicar una planta eléctrica improvisada la Alianza cuyo<sb>propósito era transmitir energía a las subestaciones.<sb>La yuxtaposición de este espacio industrial abandonado con los grandes<sb>cables de la Alianza creó suficiente interés visual para hacer que el<sb>espacio se sintiera importante a un costo relativamente bajo.<sb>El motivo del cable se añadió posteriormente a otras partes del juego para<sb>aumentar el interés visual y dar al jugador una sensación de ser llevado<sb>hacia la bóveda.<sb>Puede que no sea obvio, pero los cables que salen a través del techo aquí<sb>continúan hacia el exterior del edificio, a través del gran patio de<sb>construcción y sobre el techo del edificio de destilería, quizás<sb>continuando hacia una subestación u otra infraestructura la Alianza.<sb>Los jugadores pueden no notar esa continuación, pero tales detalles nos<sb>ayudan a guiarnos en la construcción de un mundo que se siente conectado y<sb>consistente.
Un problema que enfrentamos con los estilos de movimiento de realidad<sb>virtual que <I>Alyx<I> apoyó fue evitar que la experiencia de combate divergiera<sb>en función de si los jugadores estaban utilizando teletransporte o<sb>movimiento continuo.<sb>Si el combate fuera considerablemente diferente dependiendo de la<sb>configuración del movimiento del jugador, nuestros requisitos de prueba de<sb>juego podrían explotar de forma combinada.<sb>Una forma en que evitamos esta explosión combinada fue asegurándonos de<sb>que la inteligencia artificial pudiera sentir el movimiento del jugador<sb>sin importar el estilo de locomoción que estuviera usando el jugador.<sb>Para hacerlo, creamos un proxy visual para los jugadores que utilizan la<sb>locomoción de teletransporte.<sb>Imagina un escenario en el que el jugador esté a cubierto, oculto a la<sb>vista de un soldado.<sb>Si el jugador usaba el movimiento continuo para correr a otra cubierta<sb>cercana, el soldado los ve mientras están expuestos.<sb>Pero un jugador que se teletransporta instantáneamente de una pieza de<sb>cubierta a la siguiente no sería visto.<sb>Para resolver esta discrepancia, cuando un jugador se teletransporta,<sb>dejamos un rastro de migajas como proxies visuales invisibles que la<sb>inteligencia artificial enemiga puede ver.<sb>Estos proxies pasan información a la inteligencia artificial, similar a lo<sb>que habría recopilado al ver al jugador realizar el movimiento<sb>directamente.<sb>En este caso, el soldado sabría que el jugador de teletransporte había<sb>dejado la cubierta original, y correría a través de terreno abierto a la<sb>nueva cubierta, al igual que un jugador que utiliza el movimiento continuo.<sb>Aunque obviamente no es idéntico, ya que el soldado no tuvo la oportunidad<sb>de disparar al jugador teletransportador, este tipo de características nos<sb>permitieron reducir el número de formas en que nuestra lógica de<sb>inteligencia artificial necesitaba tener en cuenta las opciones de<sb>movimiento del jugador.
Para nuestros modos de teletransporte y locomoción continua,<sb>proporcionamos los métodos de escalada correspondientes.<sb>De forma predeterminada, los jugadores que utilizan locomoción de<sb>teletransporte pueden apuntar a una escalera y, después de un corto<sb>tiempo, ser teletransportados a la parte superior o inferior, dependiendo<sb>de dónde comenzaron.<sb>El temporizador era necesario para garantizar que los jugadores estuvieran<sb>usando intencionalmente la escalera.<sb>No queríamos que apuntaran involuntariamente a una escalera y se<sb>desorientaran cuando se encontraran en el otro extremo.<sb>Los jugadores que utilizan la locomoción continua pueden agarrar escaleras<sb>directamente para subir o bajar.<sb>En este modo, pueden agarrar un peldaño de escalera y mover su mano hacia<sb>abajo para elevar su cuerpo o mover su mano hacia arriba para bajarlo.<sb>Esto permite a los jugadores subir o bajar la escalera, peldaño a peldaño<sb>de una manera natural.<sb>Este modo resultó ser tan popular que lo añadimos como una opción incluso<sb>para los jugadores que utilizan locomoción de teletransporte.<sb>La mayoría de las escaleras de nuestro juego no se extienden mucho más<sb>allá de la zona de aterrizaje superior.<sb>Esto hizo que desmontar la parte superior de una escalera fuera un desafío<sb>para los jugadores que usan escalada continua, ya que hay muy poca<sb>escalera a la que agarrarse por encima del área de aterrizaje superior.<sb>Para resolver esto, detectamos cuando los jugadores dejan de sostener la<sb>escalera con ambas manos y los teletransportamos automáticamente a la<sb>parte superior o inferior, en función de la dirección en la que estaban<sb>subiendo.<sb>Desafortunadamente, no tenemos mucho entrenamiento explícito de escalera<sb>en el juego, por lo que algunos jugadores se sorprenden por este<sb>comportamiento de teletransporte si accidentalmente se sueltan con ambas<sb>manos mientras suben.<sb>Sin embargo, esta era una mejor alternativa a dejar a los jugadores<sb>colgados o forzarlos a caerse si se sueltan con ambas manos, especialmente<sb>porque algunas de nuestras escaleras son bastante largas y sería tedioso<sb>tener que volver a subir solo porque un jugador se soltó poco antes de<sb>llegar a la cima.
Algunos de nuestros primeros experimentos en el proyecto sugirieron<sb>colocar viejos modelos <I>Half-Life 2<I> en un nivel y caminar alrededor de<sb>ellos en realidad virtual.<sb>Estos incluían modelos estáticos de enemigos como soldados de la Alianza o<sb>zombis.<sb>Encontramos que a los jugadores realmente les gustaba poder inspeccionar<sb>estos modelos, porque la realidad virtual les permitía acercarse mucho más<sb>de lo que habían podido en el pasado.<sb>Los jugadores informaron tener una idea del verdadero tamaño de los<sb>personajes y a menudo señalaban detalles que nunca habían notado antes, a<sb>pesar de que habían visto a los modelos muchas veces a lo largo de<sb><I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Estas reacciones nos llevaron a la idea de crear un enemigo que aprovechó<sb>esa experiencia, uno que requirió que los jugadores pasaran largos<sb>periodos en estrecha proximidad física.<sb>Pero los enemigos no suelen dejar que el jugador se acerque a ellos sin<sb>atacar, por lo que sentimos que tenía sentido ficticio que este enemigo<sb>fuera ciego, y que incluyera el juego sin combate como su enfoque.<sb>Los primeros experimentos con guiar a una criatura ciega usando sonidos<sb>fueron inmediatamente interesantes y nos dieron una manera de crear<sb>escenarios únicos para el producto.<sb>Por lo tanto, nació el concepto de Jeff, conocido internamente como el<sb>"zombi ciego".
La flora Xen que ves en la pared aquí, a la que nos referimos como "orejas Xen"<sb>por razones obvias, se anima en reacción a<sb>los mismos sonidos que Jeff.<sb>Al principio del desarrollo, vimos situaciones en las que los jugadores de<sb>prueba no notaban que Jeff se enfurecía por un sonido.<sb>Si el jugador moría como resultado, se sentían frustrados.<sb>Trabajamos para hacer que las animaciones y sonidos de Jeff comunicaran su<sb>nivel de agresión al jugador lo más claramente posible, pero si los<sb>jugadores no estaban mirando a Jeff, aún podrían<sb>ser capturados sin darse cuenta.<sb>Añadir la vegetación de orejas Xen al medio ambiente fue una manera de<sb>ayudar a los jugadores a ser más conscientes de las reacciones de Jeff al sonido.<sb>Las orejas Xen funcionan como una capa adicional de interacción visual<sb>para el estado de comportamiento de Jeff; uno que vive en el entorno en<sb>lugar de en el propio Jeff.
Desde el principio del desarrollo, queríamos presentar una variedad de<sb>flora y fauna Xen visualmente distinta<cr>en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Pero aún no sabíamos cómo se usarían esos elementos visuales para crear<sb>una jugabilidad interesante.<sb>Conocidas internamente como "plantas carnívoras de Xen", las plantas Xen<sb>que ves aquí fueron construidas originalmente para agregar riqueza visual<sb>al mundo y solo eran ligeramente interactivas.<sb>Podían rastrear la cabeza y las manos del jugador, y se cerraban con<sb>fuerza si el jugador se acercaba demasiado.<sb>Cuando empezamos a trabajar en Jeff, queríamos encontrar nuevas formas<sb>sorprendentes de usar el sonido como mecánica de juego principal.<sb>En particular, queríamos hacer que los jugadores<sb>desconfiaran del entorno a su alrededor.<sb>Nos dimos cuenta de que podíamos usar las plantas carnívoras de Xen como<sb>un tipo de peligro de ruido al hacer que<sb>se abrieran y cerraran repetidamente cuando el jugador se acercara.<sb>Ya habíamos colocado estas plantas carnívoras en partes anteriores del<sb>juego, lo que significaba que los jugadores llegarían a la destilería con<sb>una comprensión de cómo funcionaban.<sb>La introducción de Jeff cambió la relación del jugador con las plantas<sb>carnívoras de Xen, ya que pasaron de ser inofensivas pero molestas a un<sb>peligro que los jugadores tendrían que evitar.
Las primeras versiones de la destilería exploraron una variedad de métodos<sb>para enseñar sutilmente a los jugadores cómo trabaja Jeff sin ninguna<sb>exposición explícita.<sb>Aunque algunas de las técnicas de entrenamiento fueron bastante exitosas,<sb>no tener una comprensión completa del comportamiento de Jeff dio como<sb>resultado que los jugadores se abrieran camino a través de esta sección<sb>del juego y lo pasaran fatal haciéndolo.<sb>Finalmente, determinamos que el entrenamiento explícito era necesario, y<sb>ahí es donde entró el personaje de Larry.<sb>Larry actúa como una puerta entregando información importante sobre el<sb>comportamiento de Jeff antes de permitir que el jugador continúe.<sb>Es un entorno de aprendizaje denso y un delicado acto de equilibrio, y se<sb>asegura de que cumplamos las reglas de Jeff mientras seguimos haciendo de<sb>Larry un personaje interesante.<sb>Para difundir la exposición, notarás que está distribuida en varios ritmos<sb>de historia diferentes cuando Larry primero presenta a Jeff, luego<sb>demuestra la reacción predecible de Jeff a una botella que se rompe y<sb>finalmente explica que el jugador puede evitar su propia tos por culpa de<sb>las esporas Xen cubriéndose la boca.
Un elemento central tanto del medio ambiente como del propio Jeff son las<sb>plantas Xen que se ven aquí vomitando gas tóxico,<sb>lo que hace que el jugador tosa.<sb>No las creamos para ser meramente ornamentales o para apoyar la novedosa<sb>interacción de realidad virtual para que<sb>los jugadores se cubrieran la boca.<sb>Las agregamos específicamente para resolver un desafío que siempre<sb>tuvimos: teníamos al ilustrar el espacio personal de Jeff.<sb>Uno de los aspectos más complicados del diseño de Jeff fue encontrar el<sb>equilibrio adecuado entre la amenaza percibida y la amenaza real.<sb>Muchos escenarios en el nivel obligan al jugador a<sb>estar cerca de Jeff para crear tensión.<sb>Vimos que estos momentos podrían ser emocionantes, pero también podrían<sb>volverse frustrantes cuando los jugadores accidentalmente se acercaban<sb>demasiado a Jeff y morían inesperadamente.<sb>Los jugadores informaron que no entendían<sb>"qué tan cerca es demasiado cerca". Probamos una serie de soluciones, como agregar tentáculos<sb>brillantes a Jeff que actuaron como una representación visual del<sb>perímetro de su espacio personal.<sb>Si tocas los tentáculos, morirás.<sb>Conseguir una apariencia satisfactoria para estos tentáculos resultó<sb>desafiante, y nos alejamos de la idea.<sb>Otro problema que encontramos fue que un subconjunto de nuestros jugadores<sb>rápidamente se sintió cómodo alrededor de Jeff una vez que se volvieron<sb>expertos en mantener su distancia de él y evitar fuentes de ruido.<sb>Para estos jugadores, lidiar con Jeff se sentía trivial.<sb>Simplemente no se sentía como una amenaza para ellos.<sb>Discutimos una variedad de posibles soluciones a estos problemas, incluso<sb>conceptos extraños como darle a Jeff la capacidad de teletransportarse a<sb>fuentes de ruido, pero fue difícil tener ideas que no sintieran que le<sb>estábamos dando a Jeff la capacidad de hacer trampa.<sb>Al final, se nos ocurrió la idea de que el jugador <I>tosiera<I>.<sb>Esto fue atractivo, ya que nos dio una manera de hacer que el jugador<sb>mismo fuera una fuente de ruido, lo que causaría que Jeff lo persiguiera.<sb>También estábamos interesados
en hacer el medio ambiente más peligroso en<sb>general, por lo que nuestros primeros experimentos con la tos fueron<sb>llenar el nivel con plantas Xen que arrojaban gas tóxico.<sb>Las pruebas iniciales mostraron mucha promesa.<sb>Los jugadores ahora sentían que Jeff era peligroso y debían observar<sb>cuidadosamente el entorno para evitar el gas.<sb>Observamos que los jugadores tenían un instinto natural de cubrirse la<sb>boca con la mano para suprimir la tos.<sb>Esta era una asequibilidad que la realidad virtual con controles manuales<sb>rastreados soportaba de forma muy natural,<sb>por lo que implementamos esta mecánica de inmediato.<sb>Esto todavía nos dejaba con el problema de que los jugadores no estaban<sb>seguros de lo cerca que podían estar de Jeff.<sb>Nos dimos cuenta de que el experimento anterior de agregar tentáculos a<sb>Jeff podría reemplazarse con el enfoque mucho más simple de unir una nube<sb>tóxica directamente a él.<sb>Esto tuvo múltiples beneficios.<sb>En primer lugar, les dio a los jugadores retroalimentación visual sobre lo<sb>lejos que necesitaban alejarse de Jeff para estar a salvo.<sb>En segundo lugar, hizo que esos momentos en los que Jeff se acercaba se<sb>pusieran más tensos ahora que los jugadores necesitaban cubrirse la boca.<sb>Finalmente, no necesitábamos enseñar nada nuevo a los jugadores.<sb>Podrían seguir con lo que ya habían aprendido sobre el gas tóxico en el<sb>medio ambiente, y aplicar esas lecciones al propio Jeff.
Uno de nuestros principales objetivos en el diseño de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> era<sb>llegar al público más amplio posible.<sb>Esto significó el desarrollo de todo el hardware de realidad virtual más<sb>importante del mercado, así como acomodar espacios de juego de diferentes<sb>tamaños, preferencias transversales, etc.<sb>La opción de accesibilidad que tuvo más efectos en el diseño del juego,<sb>desde atajos de control hasta lógica de juego y diseño de niveles, fue el<sb>soporte de un solo modo de control para los jugadores que no usan dos.<sb>En este modo, la recarga se realiza moviendo el arma al hombro y<sb>presionando un botón, al igual que los juegos de arcade que requieren que<sb>el jugador dispare su arma fuera de la pantalla para recargar.<sb>Modificamos la linterna para unirse a la mano principal y agregamos<sb>máscaras de gas para que los jugadores pudieran amortiguar su tos con las<sb>manos libres.<sb>Incluso el arma utilizada en la batalla final del zancudo, con sus<sb>controles de apuntamiento y recarga de dos manos, se modificó para ser<sb>operable con solo una.
A medida que refinamos el comportamiento y el diseño visual de Jeff,<sb>pensamos mucho en cómo queríamos que los jugadores se sintieran por él.<sb>El objetivo era que los jugadores describieran a Jeff con palabras como<sb>"amenazante" y "letal". Y por esa razón, se hizo importante que los<sb>jugadores no sobrevivieran si se acercaban demasiado a Jeff, así que<sb>decidimos que su ataque debería resultar en la muerte instantánea.<sb>Esto enseñaría a los jugadores inequívocamente que Jeff era demasiado<sb>peligroso, pero nos dejó con el desafío de enseñar esto a los jugadores<sb>sin necesariamente matarlos.<sb>El enfoque que tomamos fue darle al jugador oportunidades de presenciar el<sb>ataque de Jeff y matar a <I>otros<I> personajes.<sb>Las primeras versiones del nivel incluían escenarios donde Jeff y el<sb>jugador se encontrarían con zombis y soldados de la Alianza.<sb>El jugador podría atacar a estos enemigos, o usar el sonido para atraer a<sb>Jeff a su lugar para que pudiera golpearlos con sus enormes brazos.<sb>Esto dio a los jugadores la oportunidad de presenciar el poder de Jeff y<sb>su método de ataque sin morir en sus manos.<sb>Desafortunadamente, este resultado no estaba garantizado, ya que algunos<sb>jugadores optaban por matar a esos enemigos ellos mismos.<sb>Y tener a estos otros personajes presentes también era bastante caro en<sb>términos de animación, sonido y contenido de nivel.<sb>Ya estábamos lidiando con el desafío de mantener este nivel a buen ritmo y<sb>dentro del alcance, por lo que cortamos estas secciones.<sb>Pero esto todavía nos dejó con el problema original de cómo demostrar la<sb>habilidad de Jeff para matar sin matar al jugador.<sb>Elegimos abordar esto agregando ritmos a las secuencias animadas existentes.<sb>Por ejemplo, cuando el jugador abre esta puerta corrediza de dos manos,<sb>agregamos un cangrejo para que Jeff se lo comiera<sb>a plena vista del jugador.<sb>También añadimos un ritmo similar al del ascensor posterior con Jeff<sb>rompiendo un cangrejo contra la pared antes de derretirlo con ácido.
A pesar de que Larry instruye al jugador sobre los conceptos básicos de<sb>cómo funciona Jeff, descubrimos que necesitábamos dejar que los jugadores<sb>pusieran a prueba esas reglas sin tener a Jeff en su espacio personal<sb>inmediato.<sb>Si hiciéramos que los jugadores interactuaran primero con Jeff cara a<sb>cara, a menudo se les olvidaba lo aprendido.<sb>Morían una y otra vez, y su miedo a Jeff se convirtió rápidamente en<sb>frustración y molestia.<sb>Creamos esta área para servir como un campo de juego de entrenamiento,<sb>donde los jugadores pueden observar a Jeff reaccionando a varios sonidos<sb>mientras permanecen a salvo de sus ataques.<sb>Contiene muchos de los elementos que se encuentran a lo largo del resto<sb>del nivel, incluidas las botellas que caen, un candado que debe dispararse<sb>y varios tipos de plantas Xen.<sb>Jeff permanece lo suficientemente cerca como para sentirse amenazante,<sb>pero no puede atacar al jugador.<sb>Los jugadores pueden pasar todo el tiempo que necesiten aquí, y seguir<sb>adelante cuando sientan que tienen un buen control sobre cómo trabaja Jeff.
El diseño del personaje de Jeff pasó por varias revisiones importantes en<sb>el transcurso del desarrollo.<sb>Solo mirándolo, queríamos que los jugadores entendieran ciertos puntos<sb>sobre el personaje.<sb>Nuestra primera prioridad era comunicar su ceguera.<sb>En segundo lugar, queríamos que el personaje se sintiera físicamente imponente.<sb>Después de todo, todo el concepto de Jeff había surgido de nuestra<sb>observación de que solo estar cerca de un personaje en realidad virtual<sb>podría ser una experiencia poderosa.<sb>Finalmente, queríamos que los jugadores entendieran el estado de<sb>comportamiento del zombi ciego de un vistazo.<sb>¿Se siente enojado? ¿Acaba de escuchar algo<sb>y se siente curioso? Y así sucesivamente.<sb>El primer diseño que modelamos y animamos fue una especie de robot obrero<sb>de la Alianza.<sb>El rostro del robot presentaba una pantalla holográfica que podía girar<sb>entre diferentes íconos que representaban su estado.<sb>Una gran barra de refuerzo sobresalía por la parte posterior de la cabeza<sb>del robot, lo que encendía la electricidad y escupía humo.<sb>Esto estaba destinado a demostrar que sus sensores visuales estaban<sb>deteriorados, lo que lo hace ciego.<sb>Hicimos al robot alto e imponente.<sb>Parecía pesado, impredecible y peligroso.<sb>Sin embargo, las reacciones de los jugadores a este diseño robótico<sb>mostraron que tenía problemas.<sb>Los jugadores inicialmente se concentraban en la pantalla holográfica de la cabeza.<sb>Analizar la cara y entender el significado de los íconos resultó demasiado<sb>difícil para los jugadores, y peor aún, este elemento los distrajo de la<sb>barra de refuerzo en la cabeza del robot y su comprensión de que era ciego.<sb>Los jugadores pensaban que el robot imponente, pero no estábamos<sb>recibiendo la reacción profundamente visceral del miedo que deseábamos.<sb>Un viaje de vuelta al tablero de dibujo nos llevó con el personaje más<sb>orgánico que ves frente a ti.<sb>Inspirándonos en la idea de que los mineros del carbón sucumbieran a la<sb>enfermedad de pulmón negro, nos centramos en el concepto de un miembro del<sb>equipo de limpieza Xen de la Alianza que había sucumbido a la infección<sb>por Xen.<sb>Esto nos dio la reacción visceral de los jugadores que estábamos buscando.<sb>Un rostro humano sigue siendo visible, pero los ojos están claramente<sb>deteriorados, lo que muestra la ceguera.<sb>La naturaleza orgánica de este diseño nos permitió apoyarnos más en el<sb>audio para retroalimentar el estado conductual, con gruñidos y rugidos<sb>animalistas que llegaron a incluir más elementos de sonido humano<sb>con el tiempo.
Los acertijos de conexión de la corriente eléctrica son una herramienta de<sb>diseño útil, ya que obligan a los jugadores a moverse por el entorno y<sb>también ocupan su mano principal a través del uso de la multiherramienta.<sb>En esta área, el jugador tiene que apuntar su linterna para navegar,<sb>apuntar su mano hacia afuera para teletransportarse, taparse la boca para<sb>evitar la tos, seguir los cables con la multiherramienta y potencialmente<sb>tirar de las botellas con sus guantes de gravedad.<sb>El jugador tiene que hacer compensaciones a medida que avanza, ya que sus<sb>dos manos están comprometidas por diseño.<sb>Los jugadores con una sola mano están aún más abrumados por estas diversas<sb>tareas.<sb>Por eso llenamos la destilería con máscaras de gas que el jugador puede<sb>colocar en su boca para que no tengan que usar una mano para amortiguar la<sb>tos.<sb>Este acertijo de conexión de la corriente eléctrica pasó por varias<sb>revisiones, muchas de las cuales dejaron a Jeff libre para vagar mientras<sb>los jugadores trabajaban en el acertijo.<sb>Pero esto dio como resultado que los jugadores tuvieran que maniobrar<sb>demasiados elementos a la vez, y su miedo a Jeff se convirtió rápidamente<sb>en frustración.<sb>La solución era mantener a Jeff encerrado mientras los jugadores resolvían<sb>el acertijo, con sus rugidos distantes manteniendo un nivel de tensión.<sb>Luego nos quedamos con el problema de cómo liberar a Jeff para que el<sb>nivel pudiera continuar.<sb>Las ideas iniciales eran que Jeff saliera del congelador por su cuenta<sb>cuando el acertijo estuviera completo, pero esto se sentía poco natural en<sb>comparación con hacer que al jugador libere a Jeff del congelador.<sb>La mecánica del acertijo de conexión de la corriente eléctrica nos dio una<sb>solución lógica a este problema, con el beneficio añadido de crear un<sb>momento de alta tensión para el jugador cuando se dé cuenta de que va a<sb>tener que abrir la puerta del congelador y liberar a Jeff para continuar.
Muchas de nuestras ideas para Jeff involucraron encontrar formas<sb>plausibles de obligar a Jeff y al jugador a ocupar un espacio cerrado al<sb>mismo tiempo.<sb>Un paseo en ascensor estaba sobre la mesa desde el principio, pero no<sb>estábamos seguros de lo exitoso que sería en ejecución.<sb>También había preocupación de que esa secuencia pudiera ser técnicamente<sb>costosa de llevar a cabo.<sb>Nuestro primer prototipo fue extremadamente rudimentario.<sb>Los jugadores estaban en un ascensor con Jeff, el viaje duraba unos<sb>treinta segundos, y luego Jeff y el jugador saldrían.<sb>No había un guion de nivel complicado, no había animaciones personalizadas<sb>para Jeff y no había tratamiento especial de audio o iluminación.<sb>A pesar de la relativa falta de pulido, los jugadores tuvieron una fuerte<sb>reacción positiva a la secuencia, incluso nombrándola un punto importante<sb>del juego cuando realizamos pruebas de juego en toda la compañía.<sb>Esto nos convenció de que valía la pena poner más trabajo en el ascensor<sb>para que fuera algo realmente especial.<sb>Al final, muchas disciplinas diferentes se unieron para crear la secuencia<sb>final, que combina sonido, animación, iluminación con guiones y<sb>coreografía cuidadosa de los movimientos de Jeff y las acciones del<sb>jugador.
La mayoría de las veces, los ruidos que atraen a Jeff son creados por el<sb>jugador, que está tratando activamente de atraerlo a una nueva ubicación,<sb>o tal vez ha cometido un error ruidoso que podría haberse evitado.<sb>El punto clave es que el jugador siente cierta responsabilidad por los<sb>ruidos que se hacen.<sb>El objetivo del próximo pasillo era darle la vuelta a esa idea, aunque sea<sb>por un momento.<sb>Como una mascota que se porta mal, este cangrejo descarado parece<sb>sorprender y enfurecer al jugador tirando torpemente una serie de botellas<sb>antes de escapar a una rejilla de ventilación.<sb>¡Malditos cangrejos! Nos sorprendió descubrir que muchos jugadores querían<sb>comprobar y ver si el cangrejo había escapado.<sb>Subían a las cajas y levantaban la cabeza en las rejillas de ventilación.<sb>Esto motivó la idea de que agregáramos una pequeña sorpresa para<sb>recompensar a esos jugadores.<sb>Inténtalo y verás que el cangrejo se escapó para molestar otro día.<sb>El costo de agregar este tipo de secretos debe compararse con el potencial<sb>para que los jugadores los descubran realmente.<sb>En este caso, nuestras observaciones de pruebas de juego hicieron que el<sb>costo pareciera valer la pena, en particular por el impacto que tendría en<sb>hacer que el mundo se sintiera más real: una realidad completa donde las<sb>criaturas vivas recorren sus vidas incluso si el jugador no está allí para presenciarlas.
Dado que toda la premisa de Jeff dependía de mantener a Jeff y al jugador<sb>muy cerca el uno del otro, el mapa de la destilería se construyó como una<sb>serie de cámaras conectadas por transiciones unidireccionales.<sb>Al principio, usamos dos técnicas en concierto para mantener a Jeff y al<sb>jugador juntos a lo largo del nivel.<sb>Primero, cerramos cada nueva área con una puerta cerrada especial.<sb>Tomaban la forma de "membranas Xen" impenetrables que solo Jeff podía<sb>atravesar.<sb>El jugador atraería a Jeff a la membrana usando sonido, y Jeff la abriría<sb>para que tanto Jeff como el jugador pudieran proceder.<sb>Siempre habíamos tenido el objetivo de que los jugadores describieran a<sb>Jeff en términos adversarios, como un perseguidor constante o "una<sb>amenaza". El problema con el concepto de la membrana Xen era que llevaba a<sb>los jugadores a describir a Jeff como una herramienta útil, o peor aún, un<sb>"socio cooperativo enojado", en lugar de algo que temían.<sb>Otra forma de mantener a Jeff y al jugador juntos era a través del uso de<sb>caídas unidireccionales.<sb>Jeff se caía de pasarelas, plataformas y escaleras en cada nueva área.<sb>Estas caídas funcionaron según lo previsto, pero al igual que las<sb>membranas Xen, provocaron una reacción indeseable de los jugadores,<sb>especialmente cuando se repitieron varias veces.<sb>Ver a Jeff hacer estas caídas dejó a los jugadores sintiéndose como si<sb>fuera menos peligroso.<sb>Se compadecieron de él e incluso se rieron.<sb>Al final, nos dimos cuenta de que podríamos usar campos de fuerza de la<sb>Alianza, que el jugador <I>no puede atravesar<I>, como una manera de crear<sb>puertas unidireccionales. Estos campos de fuerza permitieron que Jeff se<sb>moviera a través de ellos, pero requirieron que el jugador siguiera otro<sb>camino unidireccional.<sb>Esto nos permitió construir umbrales donde Jeff y el jugador pudieran<sb>avanzar mientras eliminaba la incomodidad de las membranas Xen y evitaba<sb>las repetidas caídas que anteriormente habían hecho que Jeff se viera tan torpe.<sb>Combinar campos de fuerza también tuvo algunos otros beneficios.<sb>Por un lado, le dieron a Jeff una forma conveniente de tomar una ruta<sb>"entre bastidores" que es inaccesible para el jugador, como la que está al<sb>final de esta escalera.<sb>También encajaron muy bien con los antecedentes ficticios de Jeff como<sb>exmiembro del equipo de limpieza de Xen de la Alianza.
Crear una experiencia con un enfoque tan fuerte en el audio presentaba<sb>algunos problemas de diseño únicos.<sb>El desafío principal era determinar qué sonidos Jeff debería poder<sb>escuchar y asegurarse de que los jugadores entendieran las reglas.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> contiene una amplia gama de objetos físicos.<sb>Sin embargo, a través de las pruebas de juego, nos pareció mejor usar solo<sb>un pequeño conjunto de ellos en la destilería.<sb>Necesitábamos prestar mucha atención a cada objeto que incluimos, en<sb>particular al diseño de audio para las colisiones entre el objeto y los<sb>diversos tipos de superficie utilizados en la destilería.<sb>Era importante que lo que los jugadores escucharon coincidiera con sus<sb>expectativas sobre cómo reaccionaría Jeff.<sb>En las primeras pruebas, encontrábamos casos individuales donde los<sb>jugadores decían frases como "no sé por qué Jeff se enojó" o "esperaba que<sb>ese ruido atrajera a Jeff". Con el tiempo, identificamos estos casos de<sb>confusión, y los abordamos uno por uno.<sb>Era vital que los jugadores siempre pudieran identificar la causa y el<sb>efecto de un ruido que pudiera atraer a Jeff.<sb>Si esto fallaba, los jugadores se sentían como si Jeff actuara al azar y se frustraban.<sb>Algunos experimentos fallaron en esta área.<sb>En un momento dado, partes del nivel estaban llenas de montones de vidrios<sb>rotos que hacían ruido si el jugador caminaba o teletransportaba sobre ellos.<sb>Pocos jugadores notaban el vidrio roto y luego se sorprendieron cuando<sb>Jeff atacó, por lo que este concepto se cortó para evitar confusiones.<sb>También tuvimos que ser cautelosos con el caso contrario, donde los<sb>jugadores esperarían que elementos<sb>puramente estéticos presentaran un riesgo de ruido.<sb>Por ejemplo, en algún momento habíamos colocado piscinas poco profundas de<sb>agua que se filtraban entre las baldosas del piso.<sb>Se veía muy bien, pero confundió a algunos de nuestros jugadores que<sb>pensaban que el sonido de sus pasos salpicando a través de estos charcos<sb>sería audible para Jeff,<sb>aunque nunca tuvimos la intención de que fuera así.
Averiguar cómo terminar el viaje del jugador a través de la destilería nos<sb>llevó a mucha discusión sobre cómo los jugadores terminarían sintiéndose<sb>sobre Jeff.<sb>Observar las pruebas de juego nos dijo que la mayoría de los jugadores<sb>simplemente lo querían muerto, generalmente desde el momento en que lo<sb>conocieron.<sb>Pero había algunos que sentían algo de lástima por él y no necesariamente<sb>querían verlo muerto.<sb>Nuestra primera versión del final involucró las acciones del jugador<sb>involuntariamente resultando en Jeff siendo atacado y arrastrado por<sb>hormigas león.<sb>Parte del objetivo era demostrar que las hormigas león son aún más<sb>poderosos que Jeff, para aumentar la tensión justo antes de que los<sb>jugadores tengan que enfrentarse a las mismas.<sb>Sin embargo, este final dejó a los jugadores un poco vacíos, se sintieron<sb>separados de la desaparición de Jeff y querían estar más directamente<sb>involucrados.<sb>Era siniestro.<sb>Además, en realidad no estábamos atendiendo a esos jugadores que sentían<sb>lástima por Jeff y no necesariamente querían verlo muerto.<sb>También hubo otros problemas.<sb>El ataque de la hormiga león se sentía muy de la nada para muchos<sb>jugadores, lo que redujo su impacto.<sb>Y debido a que Jeff supuestamente murió fuera de la pantalla, los<sb>jugadores se quedaron sin una sensación de cierre.<sb>Esto impidió que los jugadores pudieran cambiar de marcha y conformarse<sb>con su encuentro con las hormigas león.<sb>El compactador de basura fue la solución a estos problemas.<sb>Dio a los jugadores la oportunidad de decidir el destino de Jeff y<sb>quedarse con una sensación de cierre, ya sea que decidan aplastarlo o<sb>simplemente dejarlo encarcelado.<sb>Aun así, hay que admitir que la mayoría de los jugadores parecen aplastar<sb>a Jeff sin vacilar. Monstruos.
En algunos de nuestros primeros intentos por llevar a los enemigos de<sb><I>Half-Life 2<I> a la realidad virtual, descubrimos que las hormigas león en<sb>particular eran prometedoras y eran interesantes al pelear contra ellas,<sb>pero tendían a abrumar rápidamente a los jugadores de prueba.<sb>Eran capaces de entrar en el espacio físico del jugador demasiado rápido y<sb>aplicaban tanta presión que los jugadores terminaban teletransportándose<sb>interminablemente tratando de alejarse.<sb>Más o menos al mismo tiempo, estábamos descubriendo que todos los<sb>jugadores, incluso los novatos, tienen una sorprendente puntería en<sb>realidad virtual.<sb>La variabilidad de la capacidad de apuntar entre los jugadores es<sb>simplemente mucho menor en realidad virtual que en los juegos de mouse y<sb>teclado.<sb>Para aprovechar la idea de que los jugadores serían capaces de hacer<sb>disparos precisos, comenzamos a probar un diseño de hormiga león que los<sb>jugadores podrían ralentizar disparando a las piernas.<sb>Los jugadores reaccionaron positivamente tanto a la necesidad de precisión<sb>como a la sensación orgánica de que esto daba a las hormigas león cuando<sb>sus piernas volaban y la hormiga herida continuaba cojeando hacia ellos.<sb>La extirpación de las piernas fue clara para los jugadores, pero presentar<sb>el hecho de que el abdomen era invencible hasta que se removían las<sb>piernas fue un gran desafío.<sb>No hubo una solución única para comunicar esto de manera efectiva a los<sb>jugadores, sino, más bien, una serie de pequeñas adiciones que comunicaron<sb>el comportamiento.<sb>Por ejemplo, hicimos que el abdomen fuera opaco y negro cuando era<sb>invencible, y lo cambiamos para que coincidiera con las piernas de color<sb>naranja brillante a medida que se volvía vulnerable.<sb>Disparar a partes blindadas de la hormiga león generaría chispas y sonidos<sb>de rebote duro, mientras que disparar las partes vulnerables del cuerpo<sb>resultó en chorros de sangre naranja y sonidos de impacto suave.<sb>También diseñamos las animaciones de muerte para enfatizar la explosión<sb>del abdomen, y nos aseguramos de que un trozo de abdomen explotado quedara<sb>atrás después de que la hormiga león estuviera muerta.
Toda la vegetación del juego se anima en respuesta al toque del jugador y<sb>las condiciones ambientales del viento.<sb>La animación de vegetación es totalmente procedimental y se calcula en el<sb>procesador gráfico utilizando deformación de sombreador de vértice.<sb>Un campo de voxels que viaja con el cuerpo del jugador sirve para rastrear<sb>la ubicación de las manos del jugador en el espacio.<sb>Las manos dibujan senderos de movimiento en este campo de voxels, que<sb>pueden muestrearse por el sombreador de vértice del follaje y usarse para<sb>impulsar deformaciones, lo que permite al jugador batir la vegetación con<sb>sus manos.<sb>La vegetación también interactúa con el viento, lo que nos permite dar<sb>movimiento ambiental a las plantas.<sb>Con el fin de acomodar una amplia gama de diseño ambiental, sintonizamos<sb>las deformaciones del viento a diferentes velocidades, desde corrientes<sb>ligeras hasta vientos huracanados.<sb>Resultó, sin embargo, que nunca se requirió que el viento ambiental fuera<sb>más que una brisa moderada, y durante la mayor parte del desarrollo, el<sb>efecto huracán no se utilizó.<sb>Agregamos este hábitat zoológico en particular tarde en el desarrollo y<sb>requirió una extensión importante al sistema de animación de vegetación<sb>procedimental.<sb>Antes de agregar este hábitat, la vegetación no necesitaba deformarse en<sb>respuesta a la animación enemiga o las explosiones de granadas, pero por<sb>supuesto esta área se trata de lanzar granadas a los zombis.<sb>Para abordar esto, añadimos un campo de voxel de baja resolución que puede<sb>muestrearse por el sombreador de vegetación para aplicar deformaciones<sb>adicionales.<sb>Este campo de voxels de baja resolución, que es de aproximadamente un pie<sb>cúbico por voxel, se fija en el espacio y abarca todo el hábitat.<sb>Para la comparación, el campo de voxel que viaja con el jugador es de<sb>aproximadamente dos pulgadas cúbicas por voxel.<sb>Los enemigos y granadas dentro de este espacio pueden escribir senderos de<sb>movimiento e impactos en el campo de voxels de baja resolución, que en<sb>última instancia son interpretados por el sombreador de vegetación como<sb>fuerzas del viento.<sb>Aquí, la preparación se encuentra con la oportunidad.<sb>Cuando las granadas explotan, están creando vientos localizados con fuerza<sb>de huracán.
Había muy pocos sonidos de hormiga león existentes con los que trabajar al<sb>empezar <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, así que a diferencia de la mayoría de las<sb>criaturas familiares de <I>Half-Life<I>, que a menudo tenían sonidos heredados<sb>en capas, casi todos los sonidos para las hormigas león eran material<sb>completamente nuevo.<sb>Comenzando con un lienzo casi en blanco, nos inspiramos en el<sb>comportamiento de las hormigas león para informar su diseño de sonido.<sb>Dado que las hormigas león atacan en oleadas, nos pareció razonable que se<sb>comunicaran y se organizaran en grupos para atacar.<sb>Esta idea nos llevó a incorporar sonidos complejos de chasquidos parecidos<sb>a insectos, cuya versión final comenzó como grabaciones de estorninos<sb>europeos, que resultaron proporcionar más variación y carácter que las<sb>grabaciones de insectos.<sb>Aquí puedes escuchar los sonidos de los estorninos europeos originales.<sb><wait:13>Tomamos esas grabaciones y las colocamos en capas con elementos diseñados<sb>para crear los sonidos de hormiga león utilizados en el juego.
En los juegos tradicionales, los controles analógicos como palancas,<sb>discos y manivelas generalmente juegan animaciones simples en respuesta al<sb>clic del ratón o al presionar una tecla.<sb>Sin embargo, en realidad virtual, los jugadores con controles manuales<sb>rastreados esperan poder controlar las interfaces analógicas agarrándolas<sb>y moviéndolas directamente.<sb>Para hacerlo, desarrollamos un nuevo sistema que llamamos "Anim<sb>Interactables", animación interactiva. El mecanismo de apertura de esta<sb>estación de salud es un buen ejemplo de un Anim Interactable.<sb>A tu izquierda y derecha, puedes ver algunos ejemplos más, como un gran<sb>interruptor de ferrocarril, el timbre de alarma contra incendios del<sb>Vortigaunt, una rueda de manivela, una puerta de gabinete móvil y tanto la<sb>antena como el disco de sintonización en la radio.<sb>Los Anim Interactables como estos nos permiten dar al jugador el control<sb>de las interfaces analógicas mientras restringen su entrada a un rango de<sb>movimiento controlado.<sb>El sistema utiliza la posición y orientación de la mano del jugador para<sb>impulsar la animación de un modelo que define la interfaz analógica.<sb>A medida que el jugador mueve su control rastreado, el Anim Interactable<sb>realiza continuamente una búsqueda para determinar si reproducir la<sb>animación hacia adelante o hacia atrás colocará el punto de interacción<sb>más cerca de la posición del control rastreado en el espacio.<sb>Esto permite al jugador arrastrar la animación hacia adelante, hacia atrás<sb>o mantenerla inmóvil.<sb>El resultado es una correspondencia intuitiva entre el cuerpo del jugador<sb>y la interfaz virtual.<sb>Además, estas animaciones interactivas no necesariamente deben tener<sb>sentido físico; los artistas simplemente animan el rango de movimiento que<sb>quieren que el jugador pueda controlar.<sb>Estos Anim Interactables tienen sus visualizaciones de depuración<sb>activadas, por lo que puedes ver el rango de movimiento controlado,<sb>incluidos los caminos no lineales utilizados en el interruptor del<sb>ferrocarril, la estación de salud y la manivela.<sb>Los Anim Interactables nos permitieron hacer todo tipo de objetos en el<sb>mundo interactivos, desde dispositivos mundanos hechos por humanos hasta<sb>complicados mecanismos de la Alianza sin la necesidad de realizar<sb>complejas simulaciones físicas.<sb>Siéntete libre de jugar con los Anim Interactables en esta área antes de seguir.
A veces grandes trozos de un nivel se desplazan o reordenan a medida que<sb>trabajamos en el juego.<sb>Ese es el caso de toda esta área y el acertijo de conexión de la corriente<sb>eléctrica que está centrado alrededor.<sb>De hecho, durante gran parte de su existencia, esta área ni siquiera tenía<sb>un hogar en ninguna parte del juego; se hizo originalmente solo para<sb>ayudar a prototipar la mecánica de acertijo de conexión de la corriente<sb>eléctrica.<sb>En el transcurso de unos meses, la mecánica de juego del acertijo de<sb>conexión de la corriente eléctrica se desarrolló y probó en una serie de<sb>pequeños niveles de prueba.<sb>Cada nivel de prueba exploró un solo concepto de jugabilidad.<sb>Eran puntos como usar el acertijo de conexión de la corriente eléctrica<sb>para atraer los ojos del jugador a algo interesante,<sb>como la flora y fauna Xen.<sb>Crear momentos de sorpresa cuando un cangrejo enemigo sale de un<sb>respiradero.<sb>O requerir que el jugador pase su brazo y mano detrás de tuberías u otros<sb>espacios apretados.<sb>Una vez que descubrimos cuáles de estas ideas funcionaban bien, las<sb>combinamos en un solo nivel de prueba con un acertijo de conexión de la<sb>corriente eléctrica que unió todos estos conceptos en un solo acertijo.<sb>Las pruebas de juego adicionales en este nivel nos hicieron confiar en que<sb>los acertijos de conexión de la corriente eléctrica deberían incluirse en<sb>el juego y comenzamos a agregarlos a otras áreas, pero no incluimos el<sb>nivel de prueba como tal en ninguna parte del juego.<sb>No fue hasta más tarde que se hizo evidente que el zoológico necesitaba<sb>mejor ritmo.<sb>Prestamos mucha atención a la fatiga del jugador cuando jugamos y buscamos<sb>casos en los que se puede usar un acertijo o alguna exploración y<sb>recolección de recursos para darle al jugador un descanso del combate.<sb>Había tal necesidad hacia el final del nivel del zoológico, y<sb>afortunadamente en este caso pudimos hacer uso del nivel del prototipo de<sb>conexión que ya se había construido.
Cuando decidimos resucitar nuestro nivel de prototipo de conexión para<sb>usarlo como una interrupción de estimulación en el zoológico, tuvimos la<sb>oportunidad de hacer algunas mejoras e integrar elementos que no existían<sb>cuando experimentamos por primera vez con la mecánica de conexión.<sb>Por ejemplo, añadimos las recién desarrolladas ampollas Xen explosivas en<sb>varios puntos a lo largo del acertijo para sorprender a los jugadores y<sb>recordarles que deben estar atentos a estos peligros.<sb>Además, en los meses intermedios, la propia mecánica de conexión había<sb>evolucionado de una donde los jugadores simplemente empujaban una bola de<sb>energía por un camino, a una que incluía ramificaciones de caminos y<sb>cruces giratorios.<sb>Esta unión aquí en la caja de interruptores es el eje de todo el acertijo,<sb>ya que el jugador debe interactuar con él tres veces: una para abrir la<sb>puerta corrediza a esta zona trasera, otra para cambiar la energía de la<sb>puerta corrediza a la última pata del rompecabezas y otra para volver a<sb>abrir la puerta corrediza para salir.<sb>Debido a que este acertijo de conexión de la corriente eléctrica cubre un<sb>área física tan grande, incluyendo un poco de combate zombi de por medio,<sb>los jugadores a menudo perdieron la noción de la correspondencia entre el<sb>estado de este cruce y la puerta corrediza.<sb>Esto significaba que se quedaban atrapados aquí y no entendían cómo<sb>proceder.<sb>Para abordar esto, hicimos muchos cambios en la presentación de esta unión<sb>en el transcurso del desarrollo.<sb>La caja de interruptores única y el enredo de conductos están diseñados<sb>para que la unión sea reconocible como la misma unión desde ambos lados de<sb>la pared.<sb>La forma del agujero en la pared y la orientación de la caja del<sb>interruptor están diseñadas para asegurarse de que el jugador se encuentra<sb>en el lugar correcto para tener línea de visión a la puerta corrediza y<sb>ver que se cierra cuando se dirige la energía lejos de ella a la última<sb>parte del acertijo.<sb>La puerta en sí también hace mucho ruido y una cantidad irrazonable de<sb>chispas para llamar la atención cada vez que se mueve.<sb>Este cambio particular del acertijo estuvo en peligro de que lo cortáramos<sb>durante mucho tiempo, pero con esta serie de refinamientos, suficientes<sb>jugadores entendieron su comportamiento que nos sentíamos cómodos con<sb>dejarlo en el juego final.
El surgimiento del zoológico nos dio la oportunidad de presentar a los<sb>jugadores una vista dramática y mostrarles cuánto progreso habían hecho en<sb>su viaje a la bóveda.<sb>Esto fue un desafío porque la posición de la bóveda en el mundo ya estaba<sb>determinada a estar por encima del estacionamiento, que el jugador<sb>alcanzaría al final del mapa.<sb>Pero colocar la bóveda correctamente en apoyo de esa ubicación dejó la<sb>bóveda demasiado distante para crear la vista dramática que queríamos aquí.<sb>También teníamos la intención de retratar el corte de los cables de<sb>alimentación de la bóveda por los Vortigaunts en este punto, pero tener<sb>esto lugar en un lugar tan distante no era claro y confundió a los<sb>jugadores de prueba.<sb>La solución era acercar todo.<sb>La bóveda parecía más imponente, se cernía sobre el jugador, y los efectos<sb>de los esfuerzos de corte de cables de los Vortigaunts eran mucho más<sb>claros.<sb>Todo lo que necesitábamos entonces era una presunción para justificar las<sb>dos ubicaciones de la bóveda: la ubicación aquí al comienzo del mapa y la<sb>ubicación final, al final del mapa.<sb>Alrededor de esta misma fase de desarrollo, estábamos en el proceso de<sb>definir exactamente cómo el jugador derribaría la bóveda, y nuestra<sb>solución a ese problema también ayudó a justificar las dos ubicaciones de<sb>la bóveda.<sb>Los rayos tractores son un cliché familiar en la ciencia ficción y a<sb>menudo comparten un estilo visual común de un campo de fuerza envolvente,<sb>emitido como una red desde un solo punto.<sb>El uso de un rayo tractor como dispositivo a prueba de fallas de la<sb>Alianza para atrapar la bóveda nos sirvió bien aquí.<sb>Nos permitió evitar que Alyx fuera aplastada por la bóveda que caía del<sb>cielo cuando los Vortigaunts cortaron el cable de alimentación final y nos<sb>dio un mecanismo satisfactorio para mover la bóveda a la ubicación que<sb>necesitábamos que estuviera al final del mapa.<sb>A lo largo del mapa, el mismo rayo también sirve como faro, asegurando que<sb>los jugadores siempre sean capaces de reconocer su nuevo objetivo: la<sb>estación de control del rayo tractor.
El giro final del juego presentó bastantes desafíos narrativos para los<sb>escritores.<sb>El juego es largo
mucho más que una película
y la sorpresa revelada por<sb>el G-Man al final se sintió casi imposible de sostener durante toda la<sb>experiencia.<sb>Todos en el equipo asumieron que, a través de la deducción básica, la<sb>mayoría de los jugadores iba a averiguarlo en el camino.<sb>Así que la solución, como en la mayoría de las buenas historias, era<sb>simplemente añadir más: más detalles, más preguntas y más rincones y<sb>grietas a la trama.<sb>Los escritores rápidamente se dieron cuenta de que había un nombre grande<sb>y distractor

que alejaría la atención del jugador de<sb>cualquier teoría que pudieran estar pensando por su cuenta.<sb>Luego nos dimos cuenta de que podíamos usar la ausencia del G-Man en la<sb>historia y los espeluznantes paralelismos entre las experiencias del G-Man<sb>y Gordon en Black Mesa para redirigir la atención del jugador e impulsar<sb>la historia hacia el acto final.<sb>Si el jugador pensaba que había descubierto una nueva misión, para salvar<sb>a Gordon Freeman de la estasis, entonces el giro al final podría ser<sb>seguro.<sb>Para lograrlo, los escritores crearon un nuevo y misterioso personaje: un<sb>científico que colabora con la Alianza.<sb>Esta adición llegó tarde en el proyecto, por lo que los escritores<sb>confiaron en otra estrategia: basar el personaje en un actor que nos gusta<sb>y luego hacer nuestro mejor esfuerzo para emitir y grabar con esa persona.<sb>La actriz elegida tenía un tono particular con los escritores: tiene una<sb>confianza fácil de demostrar y un suave aire sureño de Missouri.<sb>Esto no solo la diferencia de los otros personajes del universo de<sb><I>Half-Life<I>, sino que hace que el personaje sea fácil de implementar, lo que<sb>es increíblemente importante cuando el tiempo es corto al final del<sb>proyecto.<sb>Y una vez que estaba en el estudio, su interpretación perfecta nos aseguró<sb>que habíamos tomado la decisión correcta.<sb>Por supuesto, todavía debíamos construir la escena.<sb>Los diseñadores de nivel descubrieron qué parte de la ruta de nivel<sb>existente podría ser eliminada para adaptarse a la escena.<sb>El área que elegimos anteriormente contenía algunas lapas y elementos de<sb>acertijos ligeros que los diseñadores no estaban molestos por perder.<sb>Alteramos la ruta de niveles para canalizar al jugador a un lugar donde la<sb>escena pudiera desarrollarse y este pudiera escuchar a escondidas sin<sb>tener una buena visión del personaje.<sb>Esto sirvió para dos propósitos. Una era que beneficiaría el misterio para<sb>que esta escena se sintiera furtiva y para que la identidad del personaje<sb>permaneciera en secreto.<sb>Pero también podríamos envolver la actuación y la complicada animación<sb>facial necesaria para dar vida a un personaje, todo en la sombra para los<sb>animadores y coreógrafos.<sb>Como en muchos casos, <I>no<I> hacer el trabajo era lo correcto tanto para la<sb>historia <I>como para<I> nuestro apretado calendario.
El propósito de este escondite era dar a los jugadores una gran recompensa<sb>por ser observadores y explorar el medio ambiente.<sb>Queríamos destacar la historia de los buscatesoros que viven detrás del<sb>muro de cuarentena, cómo podrían verse sus vidas y por qué podrían elegir<sb>vivir allí.<sb>La persona que vivía aquí se refería internamente como el "Matalianza",<sb>imaginado como una persona con rencor contra la Alianza que ha optado por<sb>ganarse la vida en la zona de cuarentena a la espera exigiendo venganza en<sb>patrullas de la Alianza desprevenidas, tal vez al final se uniría al<sb>movimiento de resistencia organizada retratado en <I>Half-Life 2<I>.
En los últimos años, el streaming de videojuegos se ha convertido en una<sb>de las principales formas en que los jugadores interactúan con la cultura<sb>de los juegos y esto es aún más cierto para los títulos de realidad<sb>virtual, en los que los jugadores que no tienen equipos de realidad<sb>virtual quieren participar.<sb>Para dirigirnos a esta audiencia, creamos una interfaz para espectadores<sb>que muestra la salud del jugador, municiones, resina y el contenido de sus<sb>bolsillos de muñeca.<sb>Esta información se superpone en la escena 3D en la ventana del escritorio<sb>y permite a los espectadores rastrear el estado de los recursos del<sb>jugador sin tener que depender de este para mirar su muñeca o abrir un<sb>menú.<sb>La interfaz para espectadores comenzó como una herramienta utilizada por<sb>el equipo de desarrollo para mostrar recursos, así como el estado de los<sb>botones del control y más información de diagnóstico.<sb>Un efecto secundario interesante de esta interfaz fue que hizo que las<sb>pruebas de juego fueran mucho más emocionantes, porque como público<sb>teníamos información que el jugador no conocía necesariamente.<sb>Por ejemplo, los observadores de pruebas de juego podían darse cuenta de<sb>que un jugador apenas había sobrevivido a un encuentro, cuando los propios<sb>jugadores ni siquiera habían comprobado su salud.<sb>Incluso vimos casos en los que los jugadores mataron a un enemigo con su<sb>última bala sin darse cuenta.<sb>Los altibajos que sentimos al ver nuestras propias pruebas de juego eran<sb>algo que queríamos compartir con la audiencia de streaming y ha sido<sb>emocionante ver streamers usando esta herramienta.
Crear una batalla climática que rematara el combate de hormigas león<sb>resultó ser un problema de diseño.<sb>Queríamos crear una experiencia de combate sostenida que fuera lo<sb>suficientemente sustancial como para desafiar a los jugadores que habían<sb>refinado sus habilidades contra las hormigas león.<sb>Pero simplemente lanzar un gran número de hormigas león al jugador a la<sb>vez no fue una experiencia particularmente atractiva, ni fue compatible<sb>con nuestro equilibrio de combate establecido.<sb>En lugar de contener al jugador en un espacio restringido y generar olas<sb>de enemigos, queríamos mantener al jugador involucrado y moviéndose a<sb>través de presión constante hacia un objetivo.<sb>Para hacerlo, necesitábamos una arena con un flujo lineal claro y un<sb>diseño poroso que permitiera al jugador mantener la vista de su meta<sb>mientras estaba flanqueado por enjambres de hormigas león.<sb>Este depósito de camiones, que originalmente habíamos construido para una<sb>escena narrativa que fue cortada del juego, tenía las propiedades que<sb>estábamos buscando.<sb>Los camiones largos conducen hacia la dirección prevista de viaje, y su<sb>posicionamiento requiere que el jugador preste cuidadosa atención a sus<sb>lados y traseros a medida que avanza.<sb>El rayo tractor de la Alianza se muestra al final del recorrido, lo que<sb>proporciona un objetivo claro para el jugador.<sb>La colocación del signo rojo brillante en la dirección del rayo tractor<sb>también fue una decisión deliberada, una técnica utilizada por los<sb>artistas del entorno para llevar subconscientemente a los jugadores en la<sb>dirección deseada a través del contraste visual, incluso en el caso de que<sb>hayan perdido momentáneamente su rumbo en el caos de la batalla.<sb>El ritmo del combate aquí estaba cuidadosamente equilibrado para dejar a<sb>la mayoría de los jugadores de prueba al borde de sentirse abrumados, y<sb>sentir que lo lograron solo de milagro.<sb>Se necesitaron muchas iteraciones de colocación enemiga, colocación de<sb>municiones, objetos, y ajustes en la ruta del jugador para lograr este<sb>equilibrio.<sb>Finalmente, nos conformamos con un diseño que presentaba un flujo<sb>constante de hormigas león que avanzaban en grupos en el extremo opuesto<sb>del espacio, lo que aplicaba suficiente presión para evitar que los<sb>jugadores se apresuraran hacia el objetivo.<sb>Los soldados de la Alianza en las plataformas elevadas desvían la atención<sb>del jugador hacia el flanco derecho y proporcionan verticalidad en la<sb>priorización del objetivo, lo que se suma a la sensación de frenesí que<sb>buscamos crear.
El objetivo de este acertijo era crear un momento de mayor estrés al<sb>requerir que los jugadores lidiaran con una amenaza repentina después de<sb>ser colocados en una posición precaria.<sb>En el diseño original del acertijo, los jugadores se paraban en una<sb>plataforma que estaba suspendida de un cable y se tiraban a sí mismos a<sb>través del abismo.<sb>A mitad de camino, los grupos de hormigas león emergerían y empezarían a atacar.<sb>La plataforma ofrecía una cobertura limitada y los jugadores tendrían que<sb>tomar decisiones entre cubrirse o continuar avanzando.<sb>Esto logró crear el aumento deseado de intensidad, pero<sb>desafortunadamente, el movimiento lateral de la plataforma causaba mareos<sb>considerables para la mayoría de los jugadores de prueba.<sb>Incluso los jugadores que se sentían cómodos con el movimiento vertical de<sb>los ascensores en otras partes del juego se vieron<sb>afectados negativamente aquí.<sb>El acertijo que incluimos conserva la misma sensación de tensión, debido a<sb>estar varado en medio de un abismo bajo ataque, pero no depende de mover<sb>físicamente al jugador.<sb>La parte superior de la plataforma de madera está deliberadamente<sb>desprovista de cualquier cubierta sustancial, lo que anima a los jugadores<sb>a saltar a las plataformas de abajo.<sb>En las plataformas inferiores, proporcionamos suficiente cobertura para<sb>proteger a los jugadores de las hormigas león, pero también los dejamos<sb>sintiéndose vulnerables en medio del abismo.<sb>La cubierta aquí es porosa y rompible, lo que aumenta la sensación de<sb>urgencia y requiere que los jugadores se enfrenten a las hormigas león<sb>desde su posición comprometida.
En los casos en que el jugador tuvo que enfrentarse la Alianza en espacios<sb>relativamente abiertos como este, a menudo encontramos que los jugadores<sb>de prueba regresaban a la seguridad e intentaban matar a los soldados a<sb>distancia.<sb>Los jugadores finalmente tendrían éxito en despejar el espacio de combate,<sb>pero se sentirían insatisfechos con el encuentro debido a la naturaleza<sb>repetitiva y estática de las tácticas que empleaban.<sb>Para abordar esto, utilizamos algunas herramientas de diseño para<sb>desalentar este tipo de comportamiento del jugador.<sb>Colocar del supresor de la Alianza de pie en la plataforma del camión en<sb>el extremo opuesto del depósito aquí es la clave para el flujo de esta<sb>batalla.<sb>El supresor no se mueve desde su posición plantada al otro lado del<sb>depósito mientras el jugador está cerca.<sb>Su posicionamiento, combinado con su implacable pared de fuego supresor,<sb>obliga al jugador a avanzar con el fin de cerrar la distancia necesaria<sb>para eliminarlo, todo ello bajo la intensa presión de una combinación<sb>cuidadosamente diseñada de otras unidades de la Alianza.<sb>Además, si el jugador retrocede lo suficiente de la pelea, a los soldados<sb>de la Alianza más móviles en el encuentro se les dice que se retiren y<sb>mantengan su posición hasta que el jugador avance una vez más al combate.<sb>Estos elementos juntos mantienen a los jugadores avanzando hacia lugares<sb>que brindan oportunidades más interesantes tanto para el jugador como para<sb>los soldados enemigos.
Después del intenso combate que le precede, esta torre sirve inicialmente<sb>como un descanso de estimulación antes de aumentar una vez más la<sb>intensidad en la pelea final del jugador hasta los controles del rayo<sb>tractor de la Alianza.<sb>Si bien la parte inferior de la torre contiene combate, se diseñó para<sb>hacer que los jugadores interactúen con el espacio de una manera diferente<sb>a la pelea anterior en el depósito.<sb>Aquí nos centramos en navegar por la verticalidad caótica de la torre, que<sb>encontramos particularmente exitosa para que los jugadores puedan<sb>experimentar en realidad virtual.<sb>Las robosierras que inicialmente atacan al jugador desde arriba vuelan un<sb>camino que deliberadamente las hace estrellarse alrededor de las tuberías<sb>y tableros por encima, lo que causa chispas y astillas que llueven sobre<sb>el jugador.<sb>Combinado con la naturaleza desorientadora del espacio, el supresor de la<sb>Alianza que emerge en la parte superior de la escalera sirve para<sb>reintroducir un nivel adecuado de intensidad y para crear una sensación de<sb>desafío a medida que el jugador se acerca más al objetivo.
Al inicio del mapa anterior, introdujimos el rayo tractor: un dispositivo<sb>a prueba de fallos utilizado para atrapar la bóveda cayendo cuando la<sb>última subestación es derribada.<sb>En esta ubicación, la consola parece que podría usarse para controlar el<sb>rayo tractor para acoplar la bóveda para la entrada a través del pórtico<sb>cercano a la izquierda.<sb>Decidimos que la bóveda se estrellara espectacularmente contra el suelo,<sb>pero para que esto funcionara emocionalmente, necesitábamos que la escena<sb>aumentara la tensión de antemano.<sb>Toda la consola de acoplamiento de la bóveda es absurda por diseño.<sb>Si la consola se parecía demasiado a un acertijo, los jugadores podrían<sb>pasar demasiado tiempo y dejar que la tensión se fuera de la escena,<sb>inseguros de si había algo que realmente pudieran resolver.<sb>Cuanto más complicada se veía la máquina, más probable era que<sb>interactuaran con las palancas y jugaran junto con el desastre que se<sb>estaba desarrollando. La primera fase del acertijo extiende la pasarela y<sb>desbloquea el banco de palancas principal que responde a la entrada del<sb>jugador, lo que lo involucra en la solución.<sb>Cada palanca posterior no hace nada excepto aumentar la tensión a medida<sb>que todo sigue saliendo mal.<sb>El diálogo de radio entre Alyx y Russell completa la escena con un<sb>creciente pánico y mantiene a los jugadores en el momento, que mueven las<sb>palancas en un intento por salvar la bóveda.
Hace cinco años, pusimos a los jugadores de prueba debajo de un zancudo en<sb><I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Fue un prototipo muy simple, pero la interacción fue bastante positiva.<sb>Esta experiencia nos convenció de que debíamos hacer un encuentro de<sb>zancudo en realidad virtual.<sb>Y como resultado, construimos varios prototipos en los próximos años.<sb>Algunos diseños presionaban a los jugadores a tener contacto muy cercano<sb>con el zancudo.<sb>Algunos hacían que el zancudo los persiguiera a través de un entorno<sb>simple o les disparara a través de una cubierta porosa.<sb>En otros casos, el zancudo destruiría una pared detrás de la cual el<sb>jugador se escondía o haría acciones que el jugador estaba destinado a<sb>observar.<sb>Un prototipo construido en 2017 enfrentó al jugador directamente con el<sb>zancudo en una cantera, y combina muchas de nuestras ideas en una sola<sb>experiencia.<sb>Basado en el éxito de este prototipo, el equipo pasó a construir la<sb>experiencia final que tienes adelante, aunque nos tomó otros tres años<sb>refinarla.<sb>Cada iteración nos trajo un nuevo conjunto de reglas y expectativas del<sb>jugador.<sb>El encuentro del zancudo adelante es una colección cuidadosamente diseñada<sb>de ritmos moldeados por nuestras propias ideas de lo que sería emocionante<sb>y divertido, refinado durante un largo periodo de pruebas de juego.
A través de muchas iteraciones del encuentro más estridente, nos<sb>encontraríamos a nosotros mismos resolviendo funcionalmente un problema<sb>solo para darnos cuenta de que también teníamos que contextualizar<sb>ficticiamente la solución para que tuviera sentido.<sb>Por ejemplo, diseñamos todo este mapa para incluir el combate con los<sb>soldados de la Alianza, pero ¿cómo deberíamos colocarlos ficticiamente en<sb>este espacio destruido? ¿Cómo pudimos acercar un zancudo discapacitado al<sb>jugador? ¿Qué estaba haciendo la Alianza aquí antes del colapso de la<sb>bóveda? Colocamos este soldado aquí para comunicarle al jugador que<sb>algunos de la Alianza estaban en el área investigando una infestación de<sb>hormigas león antes de que la bóveda cayera sobre ellos.<sb>De hecho, se pueden ver algunas hormigas león muertas cerca.<sb>Si escuchas atentamente, escucharás al soldado tratando de contactar al<sb>resto de su escuadrón, lo que le informa al jugador que no está solo y que<sb>es probable que haya más combate por delante.
Aunque podíamos explicarlo con algunos soldados de la Alianza esparcidos<sb>por la zona sobrantes que investigaban la infestación de hormigas león,<sb>necesitábamos una manera de justificar los grandes escuadrones de la<sb>Alianza en los encuentros de combate que ocurren más adelante en el nivel.<sb>Estos dos soldados de la Alianza son parte de un escuadrón enviado en<sb>busca de supervivientes después del colapso de la bóveda y su diálogo está<sb>diseñado para informar al jugador que este zancudo que hallaron<sb><I>podría no estar muerto<I>.<sb>En ficción, es el combate del jugador con estos dos soldados lo que alerta<sb>al resto de la Alianza en esta área sobre la presencia de este.
Para muchos jugadores, los zancudos son los enemigos más temidos y<sb>poderosos de la franquicia de <I>Half-Life<I>, y pensamos que sería interesante<sb>revertir las expectativas de los jugadores y experimentar lo que se<sb>sentiría formar un equipo y cooperar con un zancudo.<sb>Nuestro concepto inicial se inspiró en la fábula del Esopo de<sb><I>El león y el ratón<I>, con el jugador liberando un zancudo discapacitado que<sb>más tarde ayudaría al jugador a escapar despejando el camino hacia<sb>adelante.<sb>Inicialmente, el estacionamiento era un silo de la Alianza, y era mucho<sb>más fácil en la ficción tener algún tipo de dispositivo de la Alianza que<sb>pudiera restringir un zancudo sin lesiones.<sb>Cuando la ubicación cambió a un garaje de estacionamiento colapsado,<sb>restringimos el zancudo al atraparlo en el eje del ascensor sostenido por<sb>el vagón del elevador.<sb>Después de ser liberado, el zancudo herido arremetería contra todo lo<sb>cercano, la Alianza y el jugador por igual, mientras trataba de escapar.<sb>Esta era una buena historia en papel, pero expresarla de una manera<sb>comprensible por los jugadores resultó ser difícil.<sb>Mantener el zancudo por todo el nivel alternando entre estados heridos y<sb>enojados mientras el jugador avanzaba lentamente a través del garaje era<sb>confuso para los jugadores y tuvimos dificultades tratando de encontrar el<sb>equilibrio adecuado.<sb>Los comentarios de las pruebas de juego fueron muy consistentes en torno a<sb>esto, así que, aunque nos encantó la idea, la dejamos por una dinámica más<sb>directa de <I>cazador y presa<I> que finalmente es la que usamos.<sb>Sin embargo, el año que pasamos persiguiendo la idea de <I>El león y el ratón<I><sb>no se desperdició, ya que creamos y refinamos muchos de los diferentes<sb>ritmos de historia que usamos.<sb>También elaboramos algunas actuaciones y tecnología que condujeron al<sb>éxito de la experiencia final.
El encuentro con el zancudo se reduce a un conjunto de actuaciones, y la<sb>ametralladora impulsada por inteligencia artificial del zancudo.<sb>Mantener la ilusión de que el zancudo era consciente y cazaba al jugador<sb>mientras ofrecía estas actuaciones requería una delicada coordinación<sb>entre los sistemas de animación e inteligencia artificial.<sb>Usamos una variedad de enfoques para hacer que el zancudo se sintiera como<sb>una criatura inteligente cazando al jugador.<sb>Los jugadores en realidad virtual se mueven muy lento según los estándares<sb>de juegos de disparos, por lo que tenemos el zancudo alternando entre<sb>actuaciones de "persecución", en las que sigue al jugador a través del<sb>nivel y luego actuaciones de "caza", enfocadas en rastrear y disparar al<sb>jugador, o buscarlo.<sb>Activar las diferentes etapas de esta búsqueda requirió muchas pruebas de<sb>juego.<sb>Prestamos mucha atención a cómo los jugadores se movían a través del nivel<sb>y luego construimos las activaciones e iteramos sobre las animaciones para<sb>crear los comportamientos más comunes.<sb>Fue mucha conversación de ida y vuelta para convertir un ritmo en algo que<sb>la mayoría de los jugadores creerían que el zancudo realmente los estaba<sb>cazando.<sb>Los primeros jugadores se cansaban de recibir disparos sin descanso ni<sb>experiencias contrastantes, por lo que identificamos los ritmos que<sb>creaban ese contraste y los cubrimos cuando vimos que los jugadores de<sb>prueba se fatigaban.<sb>Partes como el zancudo golpeando la pared, caminando sobre ti,<sb>persiguiéndote hasta un hueco de ascensor, todo actuó como formas de<sb>romper las expectativas y sorprender al jugador.<sb>Siempre que vimos que un jugador de prueba estaba aburriéndose o<sb>cansándose, buscábamos ideas sobre diferentes maneras de insertar estos<sb>ritmos y luego los probamos para verificar que estuvieran en el lugar<sb>correcto.<sb>Una de las herramientas que usamos fue un sofisticado sistema de búsqueda<sb>en el zancudo.<sb>Este sistema rastreaba al jugador y orientaba procedimentalmente<sb>diferentes partes del zancudo para enfrentar al jugador.<sb>El cuerpo, la ametralladora y el cañón tenían diferentes perspectivas para<sb>romper el efecto cuando el zancudo perdía o veía al jugador.<sb>Estas pueden activarse o desactivarse de forma independiente en momentos<sb>específicos, para hacer que se sienta como si el zancudo se dirigiera<sb>directamente al jugador.<sb>En cada animación de la secuencia, la búsqueda en la ametralladora y el<sb>cuerpo se activaba o desactivaba en función de si el zancudo debería poder<sb>ver al jugador en ese momento.
Era importante comunicar claramente al jugador que estaban siendo cazados<sb>por el zancudo en este momento.<sb>Queríamos que los jugadores vieran el polvo de zancudo y se fijaran en él<sb>para que no hubiera duda de que ahora eran la presa.<sb>Este paseo en ascensor fue una herramienta útil para lograrlo, ya que es<sb>uno de los pocos momentos del juego en los que tenemos un público cautivo.<sb>La puerta del ascensor que da al zancudo se diseñó cuidadosamente para<sb>proporcionar suficiente protección para que los jugadores se sintieran<sb>seguros, pero suficiente visibilidad para ver lo que hace del zancudo.
Durante el desarrollo, hablamos mucho sobre la experiencia de la<sb>ametralladora del zancudo volando a través de las paredes y pisos del<sb>garaje de estacionamiento mientras cazaba al jugador, pero no estábamos<sb>seguros de que pudiéramos hacer bien una cubierta destructible ya a solo<sb>seis meses antes del estreno.<sb>Para abordar esto, diseñamos la cubierta destructible para comunicar<sb>visualmente que se estaba rompiendo antes de fracturarse y romperse.<sb>Inicialmente, la cubierta se veía como una pieza de concreto u otro<sb>material de construcción no notable, pero cuando sufriera daños<sb>suficientes, comenzaría a agrietarse visiblemente y a arrojar partículas<sb>de polvo.<sb>Cuando el mismo trozo de cubierta sufría daño adicional, se fracturaba en<sb>objetos físicos precortados y generaba más partículas de polvo y escombros.<sb>A través de las pruebas de juego, determinamos cuánto daño debería poder<sb>sufrir la cubierta antes de romperse y obligar al jugador a moverse.<sb>Al final, el sistema de cubierta destructible nos permitió cumplir con<sb>nuestro objetivo de dar a los jugadores la impresión de que el zancudo era<sb>capaz de atravesar el garaje con su ametralladora mientras los perseguía.
En esta área del mapa, comenzamos a escuchar de algunos jugadores que<sb>vieron que la ametralladora disparaba de forma monótona.<sb>Originalmente, el arma dispararía a una velocidad establecida, sea cual<sb>sea el comportamiento del jugador.<sb>Para abordar la monotonía, hicimos varias mejoras a la inteligencia<sb>artificial del zancudo que solo controlaría la ametralladora.<sb>La ametralladora disparará si ve al jugador, pero se tomará un momento<sb>para fijarlo, reproduce un sonido de objetivo adquirido para advertir que<sb>está apuntando, y luego "cose" las balas hacia el jugador en su primera<sb>ráfaga.<sb>Las propias ráfagas de la ametralladora se rompen para tener un ritmo más<sb>aleatorio con intervalos al azar entre ráfagas.<sb>Si el jugador se agacha a escondidas, el zancudo seguirá disparando donde<sb>vio por última vez al jugador durante un corto periodo.<sb>Estos cambios en el comportamiento de la ametralladora eliminaron la<sb>monotonía y dieron a los jugadores la impresión de que estaban huyendo de<sb>una criatura viviente.
Para mantener el ataque del zancudo interesante a lo largo del nivel,<sb>sabíamos que queríamos desafiar la comprensión del jugador de lo que el<sb>zancudo era capaz de hacer.<sb>Identificamos esta próxima sala como un espacio donde la mayoría de los<sb>jugadores sintieron que entendían las capacidades del zancudo e hicimos<sb>esta siguiente secuencia para sorprenderlos.<sb>Para crear el momento de estruendo del marco de la puerta, utilizamos la<sb>animación del zancudo para impulsar una simulación de destrucción fuera de<sb>línea que podría ser reproducida por el motor del juego en tiempo real.<sb>Acoplamos esto con efectos de partículas e impulsos físicos en objetos<sb>físicos interactivos en la habitación para hacer que el jugador se sienta<sb>inseguro.<sb>Para mostrar bien la idea de que el zancudo ha estado buscando y halló al<sb>jugador, le dimos al zancudo un momento para hacer una pausa después de<sb>arrancar la pared para mirar al jugador antes de que comenzara a disparar<sb>de nuevo.
Al probar el encuentro con el zancudo, aprendimos que los jugadores<sb>disfrutaban pelear contra un enemigo desafiante, pero respondieron<sb>negativamente si recibían daño de una manera que parecía injusta.<sb>Para abordar esto, utilizamos audio para comunicar el estado del zancudo.<sb>Por ejemplo, cuando el zancudo no tenía línea de visión del jugador,<sb>emitía un sonido de caza periódico.<sb><wait:1.9>Este sonido estaba destinado a comunicar al jugador que actualmente estaba<sb>a salvo, pero que el zancudo todavía estaba allí.<sb>Una vez que el zancudo hubiera visto al jugador, cambiaría a su estado de<sb>"persecución" y emitiría los correspondientes sonidos de persecución.<sb><wait:3.5>Cuando el zancudo estaba listo para comenzar a disparar contra el jugador,<sb>emitía un sonido de "objetivo adquirido" antes de disparar.<sb><wait:2>Los jugadores aprendieron rápidamente este patrón de señales de sonido y<sb>ya no se quejaron de haber sido atrapados sin darse cuenta del estado de<sb>caza del zancudo.
Necesitábamos familiarizar al jugador con la secuencia de disparo del<sb>cañón del zancudo para que pudieran reconocerla cuando la volvieran a ver<sb>más tarde en el mapa.<sb>Esta área particular del mapa pasó por mucha iteración, mientras<sb>buscábamos maneras de colocar de forma fiable al jugador en el lugar<sb>correcto en el momento correcto mirando lo correcto: el cañón mientras se<sb>carga y dispara.<sb>Para lograrlo, finalmente nos decidimos a usar una puerta corrediza de dos<sb>manos.<sb>Requiere que el jugador se pare en una posición y orientación específica y<sb>ocupe sus manos para que sepamos que no está teletransportando ni<sb>interactuando con nada más.<sb>Incluso sabemos el momento preciso en que la puerta despeja su línea<sb>visual, así que podemos estar seguros de que van a ver lo que queremos que vean.
Cuando el tema central de este mapa fue El león y el ratón, el encuentro<sb>con el zancudo terminó en este punto.<sb>El zancudo se iba al atardecer.<sb>Teníamos la intención de que el zancudo reapareciera en una pelea<sb>posterior, tal vez incluso atacando a la Alianza junto al jugador, pero<sb>esta idea solo la exploramos brevemente antes de eliminarla.<sb>El problema era que los jugadores se sintieron engañados porque no<sb>pudieron destruir al zancudo después de haber sido perseguidos y acosados<sb>por él durante tanto tiempo.<sb>En el mapa final, una vez que el jugador entra en el laberinto de ratas de<sb>abajo, el zancudo reaparece y comienza a cazar al jugador de nuevo.<sb>Debido a que Alyx no posee armas que puedan dañar el zancudo, exploramos<sb>una variedad de maneras en que el jugador podría eliminar el zancudo<sb>utilizando algo que se encuentra en el entorno.<sb>Estos incluyeron ideas como disparar misiles en un helicóptero de la<sb>Alianza derribado, usar un emplazamiento de mortero de la Alianza o<sb>iniciar algún tipo de evento de física para barrer las piernas del zancudo<sb>y matarlo.<sb>Construimos prototipos de muchas de estas ideas y finalmente nos limitamos<sb>a la solución de arma montada que está en el juego final.<sb>Era simple, repetible y era una de las soluciones más fáciles de aprender<sb>bajo fuego.
En esta secuencia, queríamos que el jugador terminara el encuentro matando<sb>al zancudo en una dramática pelea de jefe usando un arma encontrada en el<sb>entorno.<sb>Esto significaba que teníamos que introducir una nueva arma que fuera más<sb>poderosa que las armas equipadas por el jugador y que tuviera que<sb>permanecer después de la pelea.<sb>Una pistola montada en un vehículo de la Alianza abandonado tenía más<sb>sentido y después de algunas pruebas iniciales con un helicóptero de la<sb>Alianza derribado reutilizado de <I>Half-Life 2<I>, nos decidimos por el<sb>vehículo blindado de transporte de personal, ya que uno estaba construido<sb>para su uso en otra sección del juego.<sb>Dado que el mecanismo del arma en sí se vería por primera vez mientras<sb>estás bajo la presión del zancudo, debía tener un mecanismo de<sb>apuntamiento y disparo que el jugador debe entender inmediatamente.<sb>Probamos una variedad de diseños, desde una ametralladora que se disparaba<sb>automáticamente tan pronto como el jugador tomaba el mango, hasta una<sb>pistola que disparara una bomba pegajosa que debía detonarse por el<sb>jugador después de alcanzar el objetivo.<sb>La ametralladora de disparo automático era demasiado simple de usar y<sb>carecía de un efecto dramático, y la interacción adicional requerida para<sb>detonar la bomba pegajosa era demasiado para enseñar al jugador mientras<sb>estaba bajo presión.<sb>Nos conformamos con un diseño que requiere una mano para apuntar y otra<sb>para recargar y disparar.<sb>Exigir al jugador que empujara el mecanismo de disparo todo hacia adelante<sb>para recargarlo era necesario para evitar que el jugador disparara<sb>demasiado rápido.<sb>La animación de recarga de proyectiles del arma es impulsada directamente<sb>por el movimiento del jugador y comunica al jugador que debe mover su mano<sb>todo el camino hacia adelante para recargar<sb>antes de poder disparar de nuevo.
A medida que el jugador entra en la bóveda y está inmerso en su realidad<sb>deformada, pierde el contacto con Russell.<sb>Como Russell ya no estaba disponible para explicar lo que el jugador<sb>estaba viendo, tuvimos que comunicar los conceptos importantes de la<sb>bóveda a través del uso de efectos visuales, física, diseño de sonido y<sb>música.<sb>El concepto más importante era que las ráfagas errantes de energía<sb>incontrolada que causaban eventos antirrealidad eran el derrame de la<sb>energía Vortigaunt que se utilizaba para mantener al prisionero en la<sb>bóveda mientras su influencia ocasionalmente ganaba la ventaja a través de<sb>grietas en el campo.<sb>A partir de la caída de la bóveda en el mapa anterior, usamos esta pieza<sb>de diseño de sonido musical para representar la energía Vortigaunt recién<sb>descontrolada que se libera de la bóveda.<sb><wait:5>Y esta<sb><wait:2>pieza para acompañar las ráfagas de flexión de la realidad causadas<sb>y balanceadas por el creciente alcance del G-Man.<sb>Dentro de la bóveda, repetimos estos temas para reforzar la mecánica de<sb>energía Vortigaunt que el jugador es finalmente capaz de usar como arma<sb>contra la Alianza al causar un cortocircuito para liberar al prisionero,<sb>salvar a Eli y completar el juego.
Desde los primeros días del diseño de la historia, el equipo de audio<sb>estableció un plan estético correspondiente que empleó un diseño sonoro,<sb>sonidos ambientales y música cada vez más extraños, culminando en un<sb>sonido ambiental apropiado para la realidad rota de la bóveda y el encuentro<sb>de Alyx con el G-Man.<sb>Mientras diseñábamos el nivel de la bóveda, se hizo evidente que la música<sb>que la acompañaba sería crucial para mostrar la naturaleza surrealista de<sb>la bóveda.<sb>La mayoría de la música en la bóveda se basa en el palíndromo musical que<sb>se oye en la sala lateral.<sb><wait:48>Al utilizar variaciones de elementos en esta pieza y deformarlos con<sb>múltiples tipos de inclinación y flexión del tiempo, creamos una sonoridad<sb>apropiadamente abstracta.<sb><wait:22>Aunque extraña, todavía era consistente en sí misma, así como<sb>conceptualmente relevante para la naturaleza multidimensional del G-man y<sb>la energía Vortigaunt que lo encarcelaba.
<I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> se ambientó en un mundo realista con reglas familiares.<sb>La presencia del G-Man en la bóveda nos dio justificación ficticia para<sb>experimentar con diferentes distorsiones de la realidad y usar el<sb>surrealismo en estos espacios.<sb>Los primeros experimentos con anomalías de gravedad y expectativas<sb>espaciales distorsionadoras fueron prometedores, ya que la inmersión de la<sb>realidad virtual sirvió para exagerar su impacto.<sb>Los entornos surrealistas también resultaron ser fértiles para la<sb>resolución de acertijos, pero tendieron a detener el ritmo en el punto del<sb>juego en el que necesitábamos que aumentara, por lo que no los incluimos<sb>en el lanzamiento final.<sb>El más notable de ellos estaba en el apartamento espejado.<sb>Los jugadores originalmente tenían que detectar y corregir las diferencias<sb>entre los espacios de apartamentos superior e inferior para escapar de esa<sb>área.<sb>En lugar de acertijos surrealistas interactivos, la primera mitad de la<sb>bóveda se convirtió en un viaje a través de un conjunto cada vez más<sb>extraño de espacios que fueron una vez el edificio de apartamentos en el<sb>que el G-Man fue capturado.
Sobrecargar a los Russell con energía Vortigaunt nos ayudó a lograr el<sb>objetivo de que un jugador desarmado dominara a los últimos soldados de la<sb>Alianza que estaban protegiendo al G-man.<sb>Inicialmente, con granadas y un pasillo de gravedad cero, fue como lo<sb>logramos.<sb>Por separado, habíamos estado experimentando con el uso de los Russell<sb>para tirar y lanzar proyectiles de energía de los nodos de energía<sb>Vortigaunt.<sb>Este fue un ajuste natural para la sección de combate de la bóveda, ya que<sb>evoca el concepto de sobrecarga de la pistola antigravedad al final de<sb><I>Half-Life 2<I> y trabaja bien con la mecánica de lanzamiento de los Russell y<sb>el jugador.<sb>Esta nueva mecánica se introdujo en un punto donde la estimulación era<sb>importante, por lo que debía ser intuitiva de aprender y dominar.<sb>Darle al jugador el ataque de energía Vortigaunt no solo ayudó a unir que<sb>esta era energía Vortigaunt que contenía al G-Man, sino que ayudó a<sb>consolidar aún más la profunda conexión Vortigaunt con Alyx.<sb>También le dio al jugador la oportunidad de sentir brevemente que tenía<sb>superpoderes, y ser capaz de usar esa habilidad de una manera visceral,<sb>profundamente física que es imposible en la vida real.
A medida que el jugador primero ve y se acerca a la jaula, el objeto de su<sb>larga búsqueda, queríamos darle un sentido musical dramático del momento,<sb>pero mantenerlo inquietante y consistente con la experiencia del resto de<sb>la bóveda.<sb>Continuamos utilizando variaciones de elementos musicales previamente<sb>escuchados, pero esta vez de manera más clara y ligeramente menos<sb>abstracta.<sb>Al igual que en partes anteriores, los elementos de cuerda giratoria se<sb>toman del palíndromo musical que se escucha en la sala lateral, pero estas<sb>piezas están dislocadas, fuera de sincronización y yuxtapuestas entre sí<sb>para representar múltiples realidades y líneas de tiempo en conflicto.<sb><wait:19>A medida que el jugador se acerca a la jaula, se introduce una pieza de<sb>piano que funciona con los tres, casi uniéndolos, pero también de pie, al<sb>igual que el G-Man une los diversos hilos y épocas de la serie de<sb><I>Half-Life<I>.<sb><wait:40>
Cuanto más surrealistas se ponía la situación en la bóveda, más difícil se<sb>hacía diseñar acertijos que se sintieran adecuadamente abstractos, pero<sb>aún comprensibles.<sb>Descubrimos a través de las pruebas que, en esta etapa del juego, los<sb>jugadores querían una recompensa narrativa y más acertijos corrían el<sb>riesgo de convertirse en frustraciones.<sb>Después de experimentar con interacciones más complejas, decidimos una<sb>presentación más teatral del momento en que el jugador libera al G-Man.<sb>Simplificamos el diseño a una sola interacción del jugador agarrando dos<sb>asas, envía energía Vortigaunt de vuelta al sistema y destruye la<sb>estructura que mantiene al G-Man encarcelado.<sb>El final quedó bastante tarde en el proceso, ya que todos los elementos<sb>del arte, la historia, el diseño de nivel, la interacción y la música<sb>tenían que estar en su lugar para que tuviera éxito.<sb>Sin embargo, estábamos satisfechos con el resultado y la respuesta de los<sb>jugadores ha sido absolutamente positiva.
