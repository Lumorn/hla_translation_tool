	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"1999024229"	"Al igual que en las otras entregas de <I>Half-Life<I>, la primera hora de <I>Alyx<I><sb>debe transmitir mucha información al jugador, y esperamos que sea de una<sb>manera natural y entretenida.<sb>Los jugadores deben conocer quiénes son, en dónde están, en qué tipo de<sb>mundo se encuentran, quiénes son los otros personajes y facciones<sb>importantes, entre otros.<sb>Además, tienen que aprender a jugar.<sb>¿Cómo se mueven? ¿Con qué pueden interactuar y cómo? ¿Que deberían<sb>intentar?<sb>Saber con exactitud qué información transmitir en los primeros dos niveles<sb>y cómo hacerlo nos llevó casi dos años de pruebas.<sb>Es tentador querer incluir todo lo que pensamos que los jugadores deberían<sb>saber, pero siempre hay prioridades en el manejo de información. Mientras<sb>más información incluyéramos, mayor sería la probabilidad de que los<sb>jugadores pasaran por alto algo importante por distraerse con algo más.<sb>Así que en los dos niveles siguientes usaremos nodos de comentario para<sb>señalar algunos sitios en donde tuvimos problemas para transmitir<sb>información a los jugadores.<sb>Entre estos nodos, encontrarás muchos otros ejemplos que los jugadores<sb>podrán consultar si están interesados en saber más."
	"529151720"	"Una de las partes más importantes y difíciles de transmitir fue aclarar<sb>con precisión en qué momento se sitúa<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> en la cronología de<sb>la serie.<sb>Aunque tratamos de reflejarlo con cuidado en varios detalles del mundo,<sb>nunca quedaba del todo claro en<cr>las pruebas de juego.<sb>Con el tiempo, decidimos que era muy importante como para que los<sb>jugadores lo averiguaran por su cuenta, así que lo incluimos en la introducción.<sb>El estado incompleto de la Ciudadela sirvió como una oportunidad<sb>anticipada para reforzar la cronología<cr>de forma visual.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> ocurre cinco años antes de los sucesos de <I>Half-Life 2<I>, en<sb>donde la imponente Ciudadela es la sede del poder de la Alianza.<sb>No obstante, como vemos aquí, la infraestructura inicial de la Alianza es<sb>una maraña de cables y estructuras inusuales esparcidas por toda la ciudad<sb>que rodean la construcción de la Ciudadela, la cual funciona como<sb>indicador del momento temporal.<sb>Reforzamos esta imagen en otros lugares a lo largo del siguiente nivel.<sb>La arquitectura de la Alianza es abstracta tanto en su escala como en su<sb>forma, así que incluimos algunos clichés visuales de construcción humana:<sb>grandes andamios externos, algunas diferencias entre los pisos, hileras de<sb>lucecitas y el trazo de una silueta con elementos verticales<sb>estructurados, todo para tratar de crear un equilibrio entre retratar la<sb>naturaleza alienígena de la Ciudadela y hacer que su construcción<sb>resultara familiar para dejar claro su tamaño y estado.<sb>Grandes vistas panorámicas como esta son un desafío interesante en la<sb>realidad virtual.<sb>La distancia a la que se encuentran del jugador quiere decir que no se<sb>benefician de la visión estereoscópica de la misma forma en que lo hacen<sb>los objetos vistos desde cerca.<sb>Por ello, los objetos pequeños del balcón suelen llamar la atención de los<sb>jugadores antes de que hayan podido ver la estructura imponente que se<sb>alza a la distancia.<sb>Si hubiéramos colocado la Ciudadela demasiado cerca, se sentiría como una<sb>construcción absurdamente enorme y difícil de asimilar.<sb>No obstante, al estar ubicada sola, en el horizonte, aparentaba ser<sb>bidimensional y plana.<sb>Encontramos la solución para llenar el espacio entre el espectador y la<sb>estructura distante con varias referencias de escala.<sb>La misma ciudad, inmensos cables de alimentación que se dirigen al punto<sb>de fuga, grandes construcciones repetidas de la Alianza, la espesa niebla<sb>de la contaminación, la iluminación cuidadosa y todos los elementos<sb>animados, sobre todo el helicóptero, cuyo sonido aparece con la imagen.<sb>Compusimos todos estos elementos de forma cuidadosa para atraer la<sb>atención de los jugadores primero hacia la Ciudadela, antes de que se<sb>dispersen con los detalles de la ciudad y<sb>se queden en los objetos tentadores del balcón."

	"2455400394"	"Dos elementos cruciales de información que necesitábamos que los jugadores<sb>comprendieran eran fáciles de enunciar, pero difíciles de comunicar: que<sb>los jugadores jugaban como Alyx Vance, y no como Gordon Freeman, con quien<sb>habían jugado en las entregas anteriores<cr>de <I>Half-Life<I>, y que, esta vez,<sb>Alyx hablaría, a diferencia de Gordon.<sb>Es probable que esto parezca obvio ahora, pero antes de trabajarlo, no<sb>resultaban evidentes para los jugadores de prueba.<sb>No queríamos que quedara ninguna duda de que los jugadores estarían<sb>jugando como Alyx, así que llamamos el producto con su nombre.<sb>Pero, incluso así, fuimos muy cuidadosos para que<cr>este hecho se reforzara<sb>de inmediato en la videollamada con Eli.<sb>Añadimos a Olga, el personaje que se presenta aquí, para hacerlo más obvio<sb>al llamar cuando el jugador sale del elevador.<sb>Olga es el primer personaje al que el jugador conoce en persona y su<sb>diálogo aquí, así como el del callejón, sirve para aclarar que está<sb>conversando con el jugador y que la voz femenina que el jugador escucha es<sb>Alyx respondiéndole.<sb>Dar a entender esto fue más difícil en la videollamada con Eli, porque ahí<sb>ya se incluye el diálogo fuera de pantalla de Russell, mientras que en<sb>esta escena queda claro que nadie más participa en esta conversación salvo<sb>Olga y el jugador.<sb>Sin Olga, nos dimos cuenta de que, a pesar de que ya habían hablado con<sb>Eli y Russell en la videollamada, los jugadores de prueba<sb>no sentían que fueran Alyx."
	"4189938815"	"Cuando iniciamos <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, nos daba curiosidad saber qué impacto<sb>tendría la realidad virtual en el diseño musical.<sb>La serie de <I>Half-Life<I> siempre ha usado la música de forma moderada<sb>permitiendo que los sonidos del mundo sean el sonido de ambiente.<sb>Pero es una herramienta que nos gusta usar para resaltar momentos en los<sb>que el estado del mundo cambia de manera notoria; en este caso, que algo<sb>conmocionó a la Alianza.<sb>En las pruebas iniciales de esta escena en las que no había música, pero<sb>sí otros elementos gráficos y sonoros, nos percatamos de que algunos<sb>jugadores no entendían muy bien que debían avanzar, mientras que otros se<sb>distrajeron con los objetos interactivos de la lavandería.<sb>Experimentamos con música de \"acción\" muy sencilla para comunicar el<sb>cambio en el nivel de amenaza de la Alianza, así como la intención de la<sb>historia de que Alyx se pusiera a salvo.
