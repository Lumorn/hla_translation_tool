	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"3595072811"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Yep, could always get worse."

	"1362612681"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ooh, an eight.<cr>Yeah, that'd really would be nice.<sb>Really nice."
	"640737631"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>I'm going full production mode on the \"Russells,\" of course."
	"3208229093"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Goldmine, yep.<sb>So here's the plan, conservative estimate, I figure one year to get the world unconquered by the Combine, get them off the planet.<sb>So that's year one."
	"3359539315"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Then another year to mass produce the \"Russells.\"<sb>Although, just quietly, we WILL need to rebuild society first, you know, to get some basic infrastructure, jobs, money, that sort of thing.<sb>Otherwise people won't be able to buy them.<sb>You know."
	"1448744400"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>So uh, yeah…<sb>THREE year plan.<sb>Let's slot the infrastructure thing in for year two."
	"3092542716"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ooh, well, uh…<sb>Hmm. Well, there would be stock options.<sb>Five to ten year vesting period, obviously.<sb>Could be very lucrative for you, Alyx.<sb>In the long term."
	"3478340714"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Yep. Sounds good… Alyx."
	"1609325051"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>So once we get the combine off the Earth, what are you gonna do with yourself, Alyx?"
	"686516589"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Well, it wouldn't actually have to be secret.<cr>You could just live your life out in the open."

	"2712206736"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>So I'd say a yes on the doors and locks just uh… yeah.<cr>Just for caution. And keep the gun."

	"1709982195"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Well, keep an eye out.<sb>Something's definitely up."
	"3945113914"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Agh! Oh God!"
	"2619513260"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Get it off!"
	"38145039"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>It's disgusting!"

	"2605669813"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh, thank God."
	"200294436"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ugh, Alyx, that was vile…"
	"551359463"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Yeah, they're putting him on the train now.<cr>Which is good.<sb>Because it means he's still alive."
	"1473913713"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No. Radio silence since he got on the train."
	"924691092"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Well, the good news is, they're going to torture him when they get to Nova Prospekt."
	"1075485186"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Because logically speaking, they have no reason to do it on the train ride there."
	"3641953208"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Well, the good news is he's probably fine."
	"2920610606"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Because they're taking him to Nova Prospekt to torture him.<sb>That's the torture place.<sb>So they're hardly gonna torture him before they GET there.<sb>So he's fine. Logically speaking."
	"812674701"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>They've got him on the train.<sb>He's on the move.<sb>You gotta find Fairview Junction before they get there."

	"3732803489"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>A Vortigaunt?<cr>What was he doing down there?"

	"2019310675"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Uh, that's probably gonna draw some attention.<sb>Not probably, actually.<sb> It's definitely drawing attention.<sb>Look, they're looking for you now.<sb>Okay? So just be careful."
	"257625285"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx! Look out the window!"
	"2521980287"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>I'm serious, Alyx. Look out the window.<sb>Is that what I think it is?"

	"2133981258"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Yeah. Your dad didn't mention it was floating."
	"137808092"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>The cables! Look at all the cables attached to it."
	"2436864358"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>All we have to do is follow them…"
	"3862473200"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>And down comes the Vault.<sb>Simple. Easy to follow.<sb>I like this plan."
	"1988605025"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alright, you — for a good reason, I'm sure — refused to look out the window."
	"25199863"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>So forget the window. On the other side of it was the VAULT your dad wanted us to look for.<sb>It's floating in the air, which makes it tricky for us to get to."
	"1632046354"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>But! It's covered in cables.<sb>I reckon if we follow the cables and destroy whatever they're connected to we should be able to bring the Vault down."
	"373308804"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, I don't think so."
	"4165885096"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>I am. Why are you saying it like that?"
	"1714080011"	"<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ohhh. Yeah, that does make more sense."

	"3996115423"	"Hi, my name is Gabe Newell, and welcome to <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>To say this product was challenge would be an understatement:<sb>it's our first <I>Half-Life<I> title in over ten years,<sb>and it's our first one in Virtual Reality.<sb>In addition to it being a great VR experience that still<sb>felt like a <I>Half-Life<I> game, we wanted <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> to serve players<sb>who've been waiting to find out what happens after Episode 2,<sb>and at the same time provide an on-ramp to anyone<sb>who hasn't played a <I>Half-Life<I> game at all.<sb>Ultimately, whether we succeeded in any of that is up to you to decide<sb>but hopefully, this commentary mode will give you some insight into<sb>the set of problems we faced, and how we chose to tackle them.<sb>To listen to a commentary node, pick up the floating hologram of a<sb>radio headset in front of you, and simply put it on your head.<sb>Once you're done listening to the commentary,<sb>you can take the radio headset off, or simply put on the next one.<sb>Please let me know what you think.<sb>I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com.<sb>While I'm unable to reply to all the emails I receive, I do read them all,<sb>and they're a critical part of the feedback we use to evaluate our work.<sb>Thanks, and have fun!"
	"1999024229"	"As in the case of any <I>Half-Life<I> game, the first hour of <I>Alyx<I> must convey a<sb>lot of information to the player, hopefully in a natural and entertaining way.<sb>Players need to know who they are, where they are, what kind of world<sb>they're in, who the other important characters and factions are, and so on.<sb>At the same time, they need to learn how to actually play the game.<sb>How do they move? What can they interact with, and how?<sb>What should they be trying to do? etc.<sb>Figuring out exactly what information we would try to convey in<sb>these first two levels, and how it would be conveyed,<sb>took us over two years of playtesting.<sb>It's tempting to try and include everything we think a player should know,<sb>but all information has a priority, and the more we include,<sb>the more chance there is that a player misses something important<sb>because they're distracted or confused by something less important.<sb>So over the next two levels we'll use commentary nodes to point out some of<sb>the specific places where we grappled with conveying information to the player.<sb>In-between these nodes, you'll likely be able to spot many other<sb>examples for players to find, if they're interested in<sb>paying closer attention and understanding more."
	"529151720"	"One of the pieces of important information we struggled to convey was<sb>exactly when <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> is set within the series' timeline.<sb>Whilst we tried to reflect it carefully in many of the world details,<sb>it was never a hundred percent successful during playtests.<sb>Eventually, we decided it was too important to be left to players<sb>to figure out, and so we put it in our opening text crawl.<sb>The Citadel's incomplete state provided us with a early<sb>opportunity to reinforce the timeline visually.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> takes place five years before the events of <I>Half-Life 2<I>,<sb>in which the towering Citadel represents the Combine seat of power.<sb>As we see here, however,  Early Combine infrastructure is a cluttered<sb>mess of cables and unusual structures sprawled all over the city,<sb>surrounding the Citadel's construction, and served as a useful indicator of the timeframe.<sb>We went on to reinforce this impression in other places throughout the following level.<sb>Combine architecture tends to be abstract in scale and form so we<sb>included some familiar visual cliches of human construction:<sb>The large, external scaffolds, some distinction of floor levels,<sb>rows of small lights and the tidying of the silhouette into more<sb>structured vertical elements, trying to strike a balance between capturing<sb>the alien nature of the citadel whilst grounding its construction<sb>in enough familiarity to better understand its size and state.<sb>Large sweeping vistas, such as this one, proved an interesting challenge in virtual reality.<sb>Their distance from the viewer means that they don't benefit from<sb>stereoscopic vision the way that small close-up objects do.<sb>Because of this, the small objects on the balcony often draw the attention<sb>of the players before they've even noticed the imposing structure in the distance.<sb>If we moved the Citadel too close, it felt absurdly huge and difficult to take in.<sb>Yet, placed alone on the horizon, it felt two dimensional and flat.<sb>We found the solution in filling the space in between the viewer<sb>and the distant structure with many scale references.<sb>The city itself, huge supply cables leading toward the vanishing point,<sb>large repeated combine buildings, heavy pollution fog, careful lighting,<sb>and all the animated elements, especially the helicopter whose sound begins in the fade in.<sb>All these were carefully composed help draw the attention of the player<sb>to the Citadel first, before letting their attention wander to take in<sb>the details of the city and settle ultimately on the inviting items here on the balcony."
	"306357606"	"In these first areas of the game, we grappled a lot with the density<sb>and prioritization of the information we were conveying to the player.<sb>Playtesting showed us that players in VR were easily distracted,<sb>often due to the better peripheral vision, such that they'd focus<sb>on one scene element while losing track of others.<sb>This was exacerbated in these first rooms because players were<sb>acclimatizing to being in VR, often for their first time.<sb>In addition, different players progress at different speeds.<sb>We saw some players spend 30 seconds on the opening balcony, and others 30 minutes.<sb>As a result, we did a lot of iteration over this set of opening areas,<sb>each time changing what information we tried to convey, and where.<sb>Initially, the video call from Eli took place in the later refuge room<sb>with the snark and camcorder, but players were often too engrossed in<sb>interacting with all the detail in the room to pay attention to the conversation between Eli and Russell.<sb>We moved the video call out to the starting balcony,<sb>but there it distracted from the establishing shot of City 17 and the Citadel.<sb>It also came at a time when players were still figuring out core game elements,<sb>like movement and hand interaction with the world.<sb>That collision made simple things hard, like when to show the player a<sb>movement tooltip if they immediately started the video call.<sb>Eventually, we settled on inserting the greenhouse between the starting<sb>balcony and the refuge, which allowed us to move the call to an area<sb>with a slightly obscured vista and fewer interactable objects.<sb>This avoided the distraction problems, and ensured players were past the<sb>initial gameplay moments of figuring out their hardware and movement setup.<sb>It also had the bonus of allowing us to add further detail to the opening<sb>balcony and Alyx's refuge without fear of creating distractions from the video call."
	"3249713099"	"Beyond conveying critical information about the state of the world,<sb>the first two levels of <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> also needed to show some of VR's strengths.<sb>Conveying a sense of scale is something VR does much better than flat screens<sb>and our early playtests showed us that nothing quite sold that scale more than seeing a Strider up close.<sb>In addition to the visuals, to fully illustrate the scale of a Strider<sb>at close range we needed to do a lot of work on its audio treatment.<sb>Players had strong expectations about feeling the weight, power and presence<sb>of the Strider through its movements, particularly as it stepped on the balcony the player was occupying.<sb>In order to convey this power through sound, we layered multiple sound effects,<sb>allowing us to address ranges in the audio frequency spectrum and the temporal nature of those elements separately.<sb><wait:5>We then combine those elements in the Source 2 Audio Engine to control them as one sound."
	"2876159202"	"This room, internally referred to as Alyx's refuge, was initially<sb>the location where the Eli video call took place.<sb>However, once that video call was moved out to the balcony,<sb>this room was freed up to solve other problems.<sb>In the <I>Half-Life<I> series, we've always tried to ensure that there's<sb>generally enough narrative for all players to understand where they're<sb>going and why, but for players who slow down and pay attention,<sb>there's more detail that can lead to a greater understanding.<sb>With the balcony being a place to get familiar with the game's inputs,<sb>the greenhouse being where the story kicks off, and the Strider there<sb>to surprise players with spectacle, we decided that the refuge could<sb>be a quiet moment for players, where they could discover more narrative<sb>detail in the environment.<sb>At the same time, it could be a place where they can play<sb>around a bit more, now that they're acclimated to being in VR.<sb>Spending time in the refuge is meant to bring players into Alyx's<sb>role in the resistance and her place in the world.<sb>We wanted it to feel like a real stake-out spot, where Alyx had been cooped up for weeks or<sb>months while planning the heist, doing research on the Combine.<sb>The camcorder, snark and whiteboards are all toys that respond to detailed<sb>interaction, and reward deeper investigation, giving curious players more<sb>information about the world of City 17 and what Alyx has been doing in it."

	"3846050888"	"We needed to familiarize the player with the Strider's Gauss cannon firing<sb>sequence so they'd be able to recognize it when they saw it again later in the map.<sb>This particular area of the map went through a lot of iteration,<sb>as we searched for ways to reliably place the player in the right spot<sb>at the right time looking at the right thing:<sb>the Gauss Cannon as it charged up and fired.<sb>To achieve this, we ultimately settled on using a two-handed roller door.<sb>It requires the player to stand in a specific position and orientation and<sb>occupies their hands so we know they aren't teleporting or interacting with anything else.<sb>We even know the precise moment that the door clears their eye line,<sb>so we can be assured that they're going to see what we want them to see."
	"4207121262"	"When the central theme of this map was The Lion and the Mouse,<sb>the encounter with the Strider ended at this point.<sb>The Strider simply exited off into the sunset.<sb>We intended for the Strider to reappear in a subsequent fight,<sb>perhaps even attacking the Combine alongside the player,<sb>but this idea was only pursued briefly before being cut.<sb>The problem was that playtesters felt cheated that they didn't get to<sb>destroy the Strider after being hunted and harassed by it for so long.<sb>In the final map, once the player steps into the rat maze below,<sb>the Strider reappears and begins hunting the player again.<sb>Because Alyx does not possess any weapons that can damage the Strider,<sb>we explored a variety of ways that the player could take<sb>out the Strider using something found in the environment.<sb>These included ideas like triggering missiles on a downed combine helicopter,<sb>using a Combine mortar emplacement or kicking off some<sb>type of physics event to sweep the Strider's legs out and kill it.<sb>We built prototypes of many of these ideas and eventually<sb>narrowed down to the mounted gun solution that shipped.<sb>It was simple, repeatable and was one of the easier solutions to train under fire."
	"3966431244"	"In this sequence, we wanted the player to end the encounter by killing the<sb>Strider in a dramatic boss fight using a weapon found in the environment.<sb>This meant that we had to introduce a new weapon which<sb>was more powerful than the player's equipped weapons and<sb>which had to remain in the environment after the fight.<sb>A mounted gun on an abandoned Combine vehicle made the most sense and<sb>after some initial tests with a downed Combine helicopter repurposed<sb>from <I>Half-Life 2<I>, we settled on the armored personnel carrier<sb>since one had already been built for use in another section of the game.<sb>Since the gun mechanism itself would be seen for the first time<sb>while under pressure from the Strider, it had to have an aiming and<sb>firing mechanism that the player would understand immediately.<sb>We prototyped a variety of designs from a machine gun that auto-fired as<sb>soon as the player grabbed the handle, to a gun that fired a sticky-bomb<sb>that had to be detonated by the player after it had hit its target.<sb>The auto-firing machine gun was too simple to use and lacked dramatic effect,<sb>and the extra interaction required to detonate the sticky bomb<sb>was too much to teach the player while under duress.<sb>We settled on a design that requires one hand to aim<sb>and another to both reload and fire.<sb>Requiring the player to push the firing mechanism all the way forward to<sb>reload was necessary to prevent the player from firing too rapidly.<sb>The gun's shell reloading animation is directly driven by the player's<sb>motion and communicates to the player that they must move their<sb>hand all the way forward to reload before being able to pull it back to fire."
	"1201999388"	"As the player enters the vault and is immersed in its<sb>warped reality, they lose contact with Russell.<sb>With Russell no longer available to explain what the player was seeing,<sb>we had to communicate the important concepts of the vault through<sb>the use of visual effects, physics, sound design and music.<sb>The most important concept was that the errant bursts of uncontrolled<sb>energy causing anti-reality events was spillover of the Vortigaunt energy<sb>being used to keep the prisoner in the vault as his influence<sb>occasionally gained the upper hand through cracks in the field.<sb>Starting from the vault crash in the prior map, we used this piece<sb>of musical sound design to represent the newly uncontrolled<sb>Vortigaunt energy being released from the vault.<sb><wait:5>And this piece<sb><wait:2>to accompany the reality bending bursts caused<sb>and swayed by the G-Man's increasing reach.<sb>Within the vault, we repeat these motifs to reinforce the Vortigaunt<sb>energy mechanic that the player is ultimately able to use as a weapon<sb>against the Combine, short circuit to release the prisoner, save Eli and complete the game."
	"193046220"	"Right from the earliest days of the story design, the audio team<sb>established a corresponding aesthetic plan that employed increasingly<sb>strange sound design, soundscapes and music, culminating in a soundscape<sb>appropriate to the broken reality of the vault and Alyx's encounter with the G-Man.<sb>While the vault level was being designed, it became apparent that the<sb>accompanying music would be crucial to selling the surreal nature of the vault.<sb>Most music in the vault is based on the musical palindrome you hear in the sideways room.<sb><wait:48>By utilizing variations of elements in this piece and warping them with<sb>multiple types of pitch and time bending, we created an appropriately abstract sonority.<sb><wait:22>While strange and dislocating, it was still consistent unto itself as<sb>well as conceptually relevant to the multi-dimensional nature<sb>of the G-Man and the Vortigaunt energy imprisoning him."
	"819275191"	"<I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> was set in a realistic type world with familiar rules.<sb>The G-Man's presence in the vault gave us fictional justification to<sb>experiment with different distortions of reality<sb>and embrace surrealism in these spaces.<sb>Early experiments with gravity anomalies and distorting spatial expectations<sb>were promising, as the immersiveness of VR worked to exaggerate their impact.<sb>The surreal environments proved to be fertile for puzzle solving as well,<sb>but they tended to stall the pacing at the point in game we needed<sb>it to be ramping up so they weren't included in the final release.<sb>The most notable of these was in the mirrored apartment.<sb>Players originally had to spot and correct differences between the top and<sb>bottom apartment spaces in order to escape that area.<sb>Instead of surreal interactive puzzles, the first half of the vault became a journey<sb>through an increasingly bizarre set of spaces that were once<sb>the apartment building the G-Man was captured in."
	"1266618350"	"Supercharging the Russells with Vortigaunt energy helped us<sb>achieve the goal of having an unarmed player overpower the last<sb>few Combine soldiers that were guarding the G-man.<sb>Initially grenades and a zero gravity hallway was how we achieved this.<sb>Separately, we'd been experimenting with using the Russells to pull<sb>and throw energy bolts from Vortigaunt energy nodes.<sb>This was a natural fit for the vault combat section since it evokes the<sb>concept of super charging the gravity gun at the end of <I>Half-Life 2<I><sb>and works with the player's well mastered Russells throwing mechanic.<sb>This new mechanic was introduced at a point where pacing was critical,<sb>so it had to be intuitive to pick up and quick to master.<sb>Giving the player the Vortigaunt energy attack not only helped to tie<sb>together that this was Vortigaunt energy containing the G-Man,<sb>but helped to further solidify the deep Vortigaunt connection to Alyx.<sb>It also gave the player a chance to briefly feel like they had super powers,<sb>and be able to use that ability in a visceral,<sb>deeply physical way that's impossible in real life."
	"3640202163"	"As the player first views and approaches the cage, the object of their<sb>long quest, we wanted to give them a dramatic musical sense of the moment,<sb>yet have it remain unsettling and consistent with the experience of the rest of the vault.<sb>We continued to utilize variations of previously heard musical elements but<sb>this time more clearly and slightly less abstracted.<sb>As in previous pieces, the swirling string elements are taken from the<sb>musical palindrome heard in the sideways room, but these pieces are<sb>dislocated, out of sync and juxtaposed against each other to<sb>represent multiple clashing realities and timelines.<sb><wait:19>As the player approaches the cage, a piano piece is introduced that works<sb>with all three, almost binding them together but also standing apart,<sb>just as the G-Man binds the various threads and eras of the <I>Half-Life<I> series.<sb><wait:40>"
	"2830940450"	"The more surreal things got in the vault, the harder it became to design<sb>puzzles that felt appropriately abstract but still understandable.<sb>We found through testing that, at this stage of the game, players were hungry<sb>for a narrative payoff and further puzzles ran the risk of becoming frustrations.<sb>After some experimentation with more complex interactions, we settled on a<sb>more theatrical presentation of the moment that the player frees the G-Man.<sb>We simplified the design to a single interaction of the player gripping two<sb>handles, sending Vortigaunt energy back into the system, destroying<sb>the structure that was keeping the G-Man imprisoned.<sb>The ending came together rather late in the process, since all of the<sb>elements of art, story, level design, interaction and music all<sb>had to be in place for it to succeed.<sb>Nevertheless, we were happy with the outcome and the response of players has been overwhelmingly positive."
