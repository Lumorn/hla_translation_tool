	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"1999024229"	"Comme dans tous les titres <I>Half-Life<I>,<cr>il faut fournir dans la première heure d'<I>Alyx<I> <sb> beaucoup d'informations au joueur, autant que possible de façon naturelle et divertissante.<sb>Le joueur a besoin de savoir qui il est,<cr>où il est, dans quel type<sb>de monde il se trouve et qui sont les autres personnages et factions, entre autres.<sb>En même temps, il doit apprendre à jouer au jeu.<sb>Comment se déplacer ? Avec quoi<cr>peut-on interagir et comment ?<cr>Que faut-il essayer de faire ?

Plus on en met,<sb>plus on augmente les chances<cr>que le joueur rate un élément<sb>important car il est distrait ou<cr>perturbé par quelque chose<sb>de moins important. C'est pourquoi,<cr>dans les deux prochains niveaux,<sb>nous utiliserons des points de commentaires<cr>pour parler des endroits<sb>spécifiques où il a fallu se creuser la tête pour transmettre des informations au joueur.<sb>Entre ces commentaires, vous repérerez probablement de nombreux autres<sb>exemples pour les joueurs qui s'intéressent<cr>aux détails et veulent en savoir davantage."
	"529151720"	"Une des informations importantes qu'on s'est<cr>efforcés de transmettre est le moment exact<sb>où <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> se déroule dans la<cr>chronologie de la série.<sb>On a essayé de l'insérer dans de nombreux<sb>détails de l'environnement, mais elle n'a<cr>jamais été perçue dans 100 % des tests.<sb>En fin de compte, on s'est dit qu'elle était<cr>trop importante pour laisser les joueurs<sb>la découvrir par eux-mêmes. On l'a<sb>donc intégrée dans le texte déroulant<cr>introductif. L'état d'inachèvement de la<cr>Citadelle nous a donné l'opportunité de<sb>souligner visuellement la chronologie tôt<cr>dans le jeu.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> se déroule cinq ans avant<cr>les événements de <I>Half-Life 2<I>, dans lequel<sb>l'immense Citadelle représente le siège<cr>du pouvoir du Cartel.<sb>Toutefois, comme on peut le voir ici,<cr>son infrastructure en chantier est un<sb>désordre de câbles et de structures étranges<cr>qui s'étend sur toute la ville autour<sb>de la Citadelle. Elle permet de bien<cr>situer l'action du jeu dans le temps.<sb>On a essayé de renforcer cette impression<cr>à d'autres endroits dans le niveau suivant.<sb>L'architecture du Cartel tend à être<cr>abstraite en termes d'échelle et de forme, <sb>c'est pourquoi on y a inclus des clichés<cr>visuels des constructions humaines :<sb>de grands échafaudages en extérieur,<sb>des étages visibles, des rangées de petites<cr>lumières et une silhouette constituée<sb>d'éléments verticaux plus structurés.<cr>L'objectif était de trouver l'équilibre entre<sb>l'impression d'un édifice extraterrestre<cr>et l'aspect familier des constructions<sb>terrestres pour mieux comprendre<cr>sa taille et son état.<sb>Les grands panoramas comme celui-ci ont<cr>présenté de véritables défis en réalité virtuelle.<sb>En raison de leur distance par rapport<cr>au joueur, ils ne bénéficient pas de la <sb>vision stéréoscopique comme les objets<cr>plus petits en gros plan.<sb>C'est ce qui explique que les petits objets<cr>sur le balcon attirent souvent l'attention<sb>du joueur avant même que celui-ci n'ait pu<sb>remarquer la structure imposante au loin.<sb>Si on avait trop rapproché la Citadelle,<cr>elle aurait été ridiculement grande et difficile<cr>à cadrer.<sb>Posée seule sur l'horizon, elle semblait<cr>plate, en deux dimensions.<sb>La solution qu'on a trouvée consiste à<cr>remplir l'espace entre le point de vue<sb>et la structure éloignée par de nombreuses<cr>références d'échelle.<sb>La cité elle-même, les énormes câbles<cr>d'alimentation qui s'étendent jusqu'au<sb>point de fuite, les grands bâtiments<cr>homogènes du Cartel, le brouillard dense<sb>de la pollution, l'éclairage subtil et tous<sb>les éléments animés, en particulier<cr>l'hélicoptère dont le bruit monte<sb>progressivement. Toute la scène a été<cr>composée avec soin pour que le regard<cr>du joueur se focalise sur la Citadelle en<sb>premier lieu, avant de se promener sur<sb>les détails de la ville pour finalement<cr>se poser sur les objets attrayants du balcon."
	"306357606"	"Dans ces premières zones du jeu, on a<cr>rencontré pas mal de difficultés avec<sb>la densité et la hiérarchisation de<sb>l'information à transmettre au joueur.<sb>Les tests montraient que les joueurs en VR<cr>étaient facilement distraits, souvent à cause<sb>d'une meilleure vision périphérique, ce qui<cr>faisait qu'ils se concentraient sur<sb>un élément de la scène en ignorant les autres.<sb>Ce phénomène était particulièrement<cr>marqué au début du jeu, quand les joueurs<sb>se familiarisaient avec la VR,<cr>souvent pour la première fois.<sb>De plus, les joueurs progressaient à <cr>des rythmes très différents.<sb>On voyait des joueurs qui passaient<cr>30 secondes sur le balcon du début,<sb>alors que d'autres y restaient 30 minutes.<sb>On a donc fait beaucoup d'essais sur ces<cr>zones d'introduction, en changeant<sb>à chaque fois les informations que l'on<sb>voulait transmettre et l'endroit<cr>où on les plaçait.<sb>À l'origine, l'appel vidéo d'Eli avait lieu<cr>dans la pièce suivante du refuge,<sb>avec le snark et le caméscope, mais les<cr>joueurs étaient souvent trop occupés<sb>à interagir avec les détails de la pièce<cr>pour faire attention à la conversation<sb>entre Eli et Russell.<sb>On a donc placé l'appel vidéo sur le balcon<cr>du début, mais là, les joueurs ne faisaient<sb>plus attention à la vue sur Cité 17 et la Citadelle.<sb>C'était une époque où les joueurs<cr>découvraient encore des éléments de base<sb>dans le gameplay, comme les mouvements<cr>et les interactions avec les mains.<sb>Ce positionnement compliquait des choses<cr>simples. On se demandait, par exemple,<sb>quand donner au joueur l'info contextuelle<cr>sur les mouvements s'il répondait tout de<sb>suite à l'appel vidéo.<sb>On a fini par insérer la serre entre<cr>le balcon et le refuge, ce qui nous a permis<sb>de placer l'appel dans un endroit offrant un<sb>peu moins de visibilité et d'objets avec<cr>lesquels interagir.<sb>Ça a atténué les problèmes d'inattention car<cr>les joueurs n'étaient plus dans les premiers<sb>instants du gameplay, à tester le fonctionnement<sb>du matériel et les mouvements.<sb>En prime, on a pu ajouter des détails<cr>sur le balcon du début et dans le refuge<sb>d'Alyx sans risquer de détourner l'attention<sb> du joueur de l'appel vidéo."
	"3249713099"	"En plus de fournir des informations<cr>importantes sur le monde du jeu,<sb>les deux premiers niveaux de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><cr>devaient également présenter certains<sb>avantages de la VR.<sb>Par rapport aux écrans plats, la VR donne<cr>un effet de proportions largement supérieur,<sb>et nos premiers tests avaient démontré<sb>qu'il n'y avait rien de plus impressionnant<cr>que de voir un strider de près.<sb>En plus du visuel, pour restituer pleinement<cr>les proportions d'un strider de près, <sb>il a fallu apporter un soin particulier<cr>au traitement audio.<sb>Les joueurs nourrissaient de fortes attentes<cr>en ce qui concerne le poids, la puissance et<sb>la présence du strider dans ses mouvements,<sb>surtout quand il marche sur le balcon<cr>où se trouve le joueur.<sb>Pour restituer cette puissance par le son,<cr>on a superposé plusieurs effets audio<sb>en traitant séparément les gammes de<cr>fréquences et la durée de chaque élément.<sb><wait:5>On a ensuite combiné ces éléments dans le<cr>moteur audio Source 2 pour les contrôler<cr>comme un seul et même son."
	"2876159202"	"Au départ, c'est dans cette pièce, appelée<cr>« le refuge d'Alyx » en interne,<sb>que devait avoir lieu l'appel vidéo d'Eli.<sb>Mais après avoir placé l'appel sur<cr>le premier balcon, cet endroit<sb>nous permettait de résoudre d'autres problèmes.<sb>Dans la série <I>Half-Life<I>, on a toujours<cr>essayé de faire en sorte que l'histoire<sb>soit assez développée pour que tous les<cr>joueurs comprennent où ils vont et pourquoi.<sb>Mais pour les joueurs attentifs qui prennent<sb>leur temps, il y a d'autres détails qui<cr>peuvent leur donner une meilleure<sb>compréhension du jeu.<sb>Le balcon du début permet de se familiariser<sb>avec les commandes ; la serre fait office<cr>de point de départ de l'histoire ; et le<sb>strider apporte au joueur le spectacle, <cr>la surprise. On s'est donc dit que le refuge<sb>pouvait être un lieu tranquille permettant<cr>au joueur de découvrir des éléments plus<sb>narratifs dans son environnement.<sb>En même temps, ça pouvait être un endroit<cr>qui lui donne la possibilité de s'amuser<sb>encore un peu, maintenant qu'il s'est<cr>acclimaté à la VR.<sb>Passer du temps dans le refuge permet<cr>au joueur de se rendre compte du rôle d'Alyx<sb>dans la résistance et de sa place<cr>dans le monde.<sb>On voulait que cet endroit donne l'impression<cr>d'être une vraie planque où Alyx s'est cachée<sb>pendant des semaines, voire des mois pour<sb>faire des recherches sur le Cartel et<cr>préparer son coup.<sb>Le caméscope, le snark et le tableau blanc<cr>sont des jouets qui répondent précisément<sb>aux interactions et récompensent<cr>l'exploration en donnant aux joueurs curieux<sb>plus d'infos sur le monde de Cité 17<cr>et le rôle d'Alyx dans tout ça."
	"2455400394"	"Les deux informations essentielles qu'il<cr>fallait que le joueur retienne sont simples<sb>mais pas si évidentes à communiquer :<sb>le joueur incarne Alyx Vance et non Gordon<cr>Freeman, le héros des précédents <I>Half-Life<I>,<sb>et contrairement à Gordon, Alyx parle.<sb>Ça peut sembler évident maintenant, mais ça<cr>ne l'était pas pour les testeurs avant qu'on<sb>décide de mettre ces éléments en avant.<sb>On voulait vraiment que tous les joueurs<cr>sachent qu'ils incarnent Alyx, c'est pour<sb>ça qu'on a souligné cette information à<sb>gros traits en intitulant le jeu d'après<cr>le personnage.<sb>Et même avec ça, on a fait en sorte que<cr>ce soit immédiatement confirmé dans <sb> l'appel vidéo d'Eli.<sb>Olga, le personnage introduit ici, a été<cr>ajoutée pour insister sur le message en<sb>interpellant le joueur quand il sort de<sb>l'ascenseur.
