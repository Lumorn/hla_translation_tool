Unable To Start Game
A game file appears to be missing or corrupted.  In the Steam client go to the game's properties.  In the 'Local Files' tab select 'Verify Integrity of Game Cache' to have Steam double-check the game's installation.
The system ran out of memory while loading the game.
Unable to find a valid Direct 3D device!
Check that your graphics driver is working properly,
and that you satisfy the minspecs of the game you are playing.
Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.
You might be using an old version of fraps which is incompatible with the game. Upgrade to Version 3.5.99 Build 15623 or later.
Error creating a D3D device! This can occur because of incompatibility with some 3rd party applications.
Change Rendering API
The game has detected that changing the rendering API to %s1 should increase your frame rate.
Changing this setting requires restarting the game, though, so approving the change means the game will exit this launch and try to restart after clicking yes.
Do you want the game to switch to the suggested rendering API?
If the game does not start properly after this change you can add -safe_mode to your launch options to override the change.
You can also change the rendering API setting later in the video settings.
Yes
OpenGL Support for Windows DLC required for OpenGL (-gl) mode.
Please download the OpenGL DLC and restart.
Failed to create an OpenGL context.
Your graphics card must support at least OpenGL v%s1.
Required OpenGL extension "%s1" is not supported.  Please update your OpenGL driver.
Vulkan Support DLC required for Vulkan (-vulkan) mode.
Please download the Vulkan DLC and restart.
Vulkan on macOS requires macOS v%s1 or greater.
Failed to initialize Vulkan.
Please make sure your driver and GPU support Vulkan.
To disable Vulkan, remove -vulkan from your launch options.
If you chose Vulkan in the video settings, please add -safe_mode to your launch options to allow the game to start with the default rendersystem.
Required Vulkan extension "%s1" is not supported.  Please update your Vulkan driver.
Not Enough Memory For Game
This device does not meet the minimum requirements.
The game requires at least %s1 of device memory to run reliably,
you may not be able to complete a game on this device.
The device appears to have %s2 of memory.
Unsupported Windows Version
This version of Windows is not supported, please upgrade to a newer version

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx ! Si tu es encore vivante, mets le casque.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Je te vois là-dedans ! Il n'y a aucune raison de ne pas mettre le casque ! Alyx !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>C'est pas un piège ! C'est Russell !<sb>L'ami de boulot de ton père ! La Résistance !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>C'est pas un piège, Alyx !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx ! T'es là ?<cr>Il faut que tu partes.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell ?
<clr:255,190,255>J'ai eu un accident.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Je sais ! Je l'ai provoqué !<sb>Techniquement, c'est pas un accident.<cr>Il faut que tu partes.
<clr:255,190,255>Attends, attends
Où est papa ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Il va bien. Suis le drone.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Il faut que tu partes de là !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bouge-toi, Alyx.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, il faut que tu sortes de là. MAINTENANT.
<clr:255,190,255>D'accord, d'accord
<clr:255,190,255>Alors
papa va <I>bien<I>, hein ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ouais. En fait, non.<cr>Pour être honnête, il est mal barré.
<clr:255,190,255>Mais
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ils l'ont toujours.<cr>Il était dans un autre véhicule.
<clr:255,190,255>
Et tu m'as sauvée, moi ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ben, oui.<sb>J'avais aucun moyen de savoir qui était dans chaque fourgon.<sb>Donc
oui.<cr>Le résultat, c'est que je t'ai sauvée, TOI.
<clr:255,190,255>On sait où ils l'emmènent ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Au centre de détention.<sb>Et ensuite, quand ils se rendront compte que c'est Eli Vance
à Nova Prospekt.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Mais je réfléchis déjà à un plan pour le récupérer.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tu n'es pas loin de mon labo.<sb>Continue à suivre le drone !<cr>On trouvera une solution.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, tout a coupé pendant une seconde !<sb>J'ai perdu la vidéo du casque.<sb>Est-ce que tu vois mon drone ?<sb>Il est en bon état ?
<clr:255,190,255>Euh, ouais. Pas de souci.<cr>Je serai là dans une minute.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell
<cr>Qu'est-ce que vous avez <I>trouvé<I> là-bas ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>C'est ça le plus fou, je n'en sais rien !<sb>Juste
des photos floues d'un
bâtiment.
<clr:255,190,255>La Citadelle ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Nan, autre chose.<sb>Peu importe ce que c'est, ils vont tuer tous ceux qui l'ont vu et tous ceux qui connaissent quelqu'un qui l'a vu.<sb>Autrement dit, nous
et ton père.
<cr>Juste une minute, je suis presque arrivée.
<clr:255,255,138>Super, Alyx.<cr>Bon, on va
Attends
<cr>Mon drone est en bon état, hein ?
<clr:255,190,255>Non. Il a explosé.<cr>Au fait, moi ça va.
<clr:255,255,138>Bien. Bon, c'est
<cr>C'est l'ess
<clr:255,190,255>Russell, ils ont papa.
<clr:255,255,138>Je sais. C'est
ça craint.<sb>Ils vont trouver ce qu'il sait, et ensuite
<cr>Ouais, ils vont le tuer.
<clr:255,190,255>Oh non
<clr:255,255,138>Mais !<sb>La bonne nouvelle, c'est qu'on a un truc qu'ils n'ont pas.
<clr:255,190,255>C'est-à-dire
<clr:255,255,138>Mon plan pour le récupérer !
<clr:255,190,255>Super. Je t'écoute.
<clr:255,255,138>Bon.<sb>Ils ne vont pas tarder à comprendre que ton père ne parlera pas.<sb>Et quand ÇA arrivera, ils vont lui aspirer le cerveau.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell.
<clr:255,255,138>C'est possible.<sb>Quoiqu'ils ne le feront peut-être pas.<cr>Ils pourraient se contenter de percer son
<clr:255,190,255>Arrête.
<clr:255,255,138>Ah, ouais. C'est ton père, quand même.<sb>Oui.<cr>Bon, ce qu'ils VONT faire, c'est le transférer en train d'ICI
<clr:255,255,138>
voilà Eli, ici
<clr:255,255,138>à
Nova Prospekt.
<clr:255,190,255>Et s'il monte dans ce train
<cr>C'est fini, c'est ça ?
<clr:255,255,138>Pas forcément.<cr>Prends quelque chose pour nous représenter.
<clr:255,255,138>N'importe quoi, ça ira.
<clr:255,255,138>Oui, prends n'importe quoi.
<clr:255,255,138>Super. Maintenant, mets ça sur la carte.
<clr:255,255,138>Tu sais quoi, je vais le faire.
<clr:255,255,138>OK, ça, c'est toi.
<clr:255,190,255>Je croyais que t'avais dit « nous ».
<clr:255,255,138>Ben, l'UN d'entre nous
moi
devra rester ici pour que ce plan fonctionne.
<clr:255,190,255>D'accord, ça marche.
<clr:255,255,138>Juste là dehors, il y a un deuxième train qui sort aussi de Cité 17 en traversant la zone de quarantaine.
<clr:255,190,255>OK.
<clr:255,255,138>Les deux trains se croisent ici, à la jonction Fairview.<sb>Tu prends ton train, tu arrives là-bas avant le sien, et tu pirates les commandes.<sb>Ça me permettra de prendre le contrôle du système.
<clr:255,255,138>Le train s'arrête.<sb>Tu t'occupes des sbires du Cartel.<sb>Et on récupère ton père.
<clr:255,190,255>Ça marche.<cr>Où est le train que je dois prendre ?
<clr:255,255,138>Tu sors derrière, tu traverses la cour de triage.<sb>Il est retiré de la circulation, mais je crois que je peux pirater ses commandes.
<clr:255,255,138>Oh, tu devrais aussi prendre une paire de Russell en sortant.
<clr:255,190,255>Des « Russell » ?
<clr:255,255,138>Les gants, Alyx.<sb>Tu sais, les gants antigravités.<sb>J'en ai quelques paires par là-bas.<sb>Tu peux les calibrer dehors, près du cabanon.
<clr:255,190,255>Compris.
<clr:255,255,138>On peut y arriver, Alyx.<sb>T'as bien entendu, hein ?<sb>Que j'ai dit qu'on pouvait y arriver ?<sb>Parce qu'on va y arriver.
<clr:255,190,255>Ouais, on va y arriver.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Je serai avec toi partout où tu iras.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bon, tu sais comment ça marche.<sb>Il doit y avoir un tas de trucs par terre.<sb>Vise quelque chose avec ta main ouverte.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pointe ta main vers quelque chose.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ces gants ne vont pas se calibrer tout seuls.<sb>Mais je suppose qu'ils devraient.<sb>C'est un truc que je n'ai pas
corrigé.
<clr:255,190,255>Je suis prête.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Maintenant ferme ta main et remonte-la vers toi d'un petit coup de poignet.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Juste un petit coup de poignet.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tu donnes un coup de poignet ? Je n'arrive pas à voir si tu le fais.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ferme ta main et donne un petit coup de poignet.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ferme ta main
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>
et donne un petit coup de poignet.
<clr:255,190,255>Hum. Ça n'a pas marché.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>OK, le capteur de référence n'est pas du tout aligné.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Essaie encore.<sb>Choisis une cible et vise-la, main ouverte.
<clr:255,190,255>Ça ne marche toujours pas.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Hum.
<clr:255,190,255>Oh oh.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Réessaye.
<clr:255,190,255>Nan.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Encore une fois.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Choisis une cible et vise-la, main ouverte.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Super ! Maintenant ferme le poing.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien, ferme le poing.
<clr:255,190,255>Comme ça ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>C'est bon.<sb>Maintenant, donne un petit coup rapide du poignet pour le ramener vers toi.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tu y es presque.<sb>Refais-le et, cette fois, attrape l'objet.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Donne à nouveau un coup de poignet et essaye de l'attraper.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>C'est ça.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>T'as compris.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Boum, ouais !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tu y es.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Visé.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tu es attachée.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ouais, tu es liée.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ferme ta main.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Maintenant ferme-la.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Serre le poing.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Maintenant ferme ta main.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Super !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ouais.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Exactement comme ça.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Parfait.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Encore une fois, mais attrape l'objet.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Attrape l'objet.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Maintenant, attrape-le.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Essaie de l'attraper.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, imagine qu'il y ait une gâchette sur, euh
sur tes « Russell ».
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Maintenant vise avec ta main
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Appuie sur la gâchette
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Et voilà.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, il devrait y avoir une petite gâchette près de l'index sur chacun de tes Russell.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Parfait. On y est.<sb>Oh ! attends, j'ai failli oublier.
<clr:255,255,138>Alyx ! En haut !
<clr:255,255,138>Il va te falloir une arme !
<clr:255,255,138>T'inquiète pas, elle est pas chargée !
<clr:255,255,138>Maintenant elle est déchargée !
<clr:255,255,138>Tu as vu où elle est passée ?
<clr:255,255,138>Je crois qu'elle est sur le capot de la voiture, là-bas.
<clr:255,255,138>Oh, j'ai failli oublier. Il faut des munitions.
<clr:255,255,138>Voilà !
<clr:255,255,138>Elle doit être par terre quelque part par là-bas.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Je crois qu'elle a atterri sur le capot de la voiture là-bas.
<clr:255,255,138>Parfait ! Je retourne dans la salle de com.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell ? Je suis à court.
<clr:255,190,255>Hé, Russell ? Je, euh
Je suis encore à court de munitions.
<clr:255,255,138>Ça vient !
<clr:255,190,255>Russell ? Je suis à court. Encore.
<clr:255,255,138>Oh, t'inquiète, j'en ai d'autres.
<clr:255,255,138>Sache quand même que, euh
les réserves ne sont pas infinies ici. D'accord ? C'est juste
pour te prévenir.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Hé, c'est ma fenêtre ! Fais attention !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh, tu as
euh, je vois que tu t'es occupée du cadenas.<sb>Bon. Très bien.<sb>J'avais la clé.<sb>Mais, j'aurais dû te la donner. C'est
<sb>C'est de ma faute.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>C'est le train, Alyx.<sb>Vois si tu peux forcer la porte.<sb>J'ai presque réussi à le remettre en ligne.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Est-ce qu'il y a un moyen de forcer la porte du train ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Vois si tu peux ouvrir la porte.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien ! C'est parti.<sb>Prochain arrêt : la jonction Fairview.
<clr:255,190,255>Merci, Russell.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bonne chance, Alyx.<sb>Au revoir !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Enfin, tu le sais, je suis toujours là, évidemment.
<clr:255,190,255>Je sais.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Allo, Alyx ? On a PEUT-ÊTRE un problème.<cr>Sans doute rien d'inquiétant, mais
<clr:255,190,255>Houlà.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Le train s'est arrêté ?<cr>Je parie qu'il s'est arrêté.
<clr:255,190,255>Oui. Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Il est bloqué.<sb>Quand les gars du Cartel ont bouclé<cr>la zone de quarantaine,<cr>ils ont dû renforcer la sécurité.
<clr:255,190,255>Et donc ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ouais, t'es loin d'être arrivée à la jonction Fairview.<cr>Tu es juste sortie de la ZQ.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Et C'EST
le plus loin qu'on puisse aller en train.
<clr:255,190,255>Je suis déjà à pied dehors.
<clr:255,190,255>Alors je me mets en route à pied.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Très bien. Je vais voir si je peux te faire rentrer autrement.
<clr:255,190,255>J'ai un zombie mort ici.<sb>Je croyais que le Cartel avait complètement condamné la ZQ ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ah, celui-ci a dû s'en échapper.<sb>J'ai entendu parler de problèmes avec des spores de bernacle hors de la zone de confinement.<sb>Mais pas de ce genre d'énergumène.
<clr:255,190,255>C'est probablement pas un cas isolé, alors.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>J'en doute.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ah, jette un
il à ça. C'est de la résine.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Et s'il y a de la résine par ici, il doit y avoir un fabricateur du Cartel pas loin.<sb>Ouvre l'
il, on pourra peut-être augmenter un peu ta puissance de tir.
<clr:255,190,255>Bon
je vais finir par être à court de munitions.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ouvre l'
il.<sb>Les cadavres ne manquent pas ici, et
Enfin, ils n'ont plus besoin de leurs munitions. Je dis ça, je dis rien.
<clr:255,190,255>Ah, je crois que je peux modifier le circuit électrique avec mon outil multifonction.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ton quoi ?
<clr:255,190,255>C'est un outil avec plusieurs fonctions.<sb>Multifonction, quoi.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, ce truc est incroyable !<sb>Il te faut un nom commercial fantastique !<sb>Un truc qui fait vendre !
<clr:255,190,255>À qui je vais le vendre ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Le Cartel ne sera pas là éternellement.<sb>Tu dois penser à l'avenir, Alyx !
<clr:255,190,255>Et si je l'appelais « l'Alyx » ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Hum. C'est légèrement pompé sur les « Russell », mais
<sb>D'accord, à titre provisoire, va pour « l'Alyx ».
<clr:255,190,255>Ouais, « l'Alyx ».
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien joué !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Regarde, un poste de soins !
le <I>Cartel<I> se sert de ces postes.<sb>Ils sont sans risque pour nous ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh, enfin, un poste de soins !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ben oui, je m'en sers tout le temps.
<clr:255,190,255>Tu es sûr ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ouais, ils sont super.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>T'as juste à mettre ta main dedans.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Écoute, je t'assure, il suffit de tirer la poignée et mettre ta main dedans.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ouais, je m'en sers tout le temps. Il suffit de trouver une cellule d'énergie.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Te voilà fin prête.
<clr:255,190,255>Aïe ! Aïe-aïe-aïe.
<clr:255,190,255>Aaaaah. Hé
<clr:255,190,255>Ahhhh. Ooh.
<clr:255,190,255>Hé
t'avais raison.<cr>C'est génial.
<clr:255,190,255>Ahhh. Ça fait du bien.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Fais attention à ce bernacle, Alyx.
<clr:255,190,255>Beurk, c'est dégoutant.
<clr:255,190,255>Alors, quand as-tu commencé à appeler les gants antigravités des « Russell » ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>C'est le nom commercial, Alyx.
<clr:255,190,255>Le nom commercial ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ouais, tu sais bien, le nom familier qu'on retient.<sb>Je vais gagner une fortune avec ces trucs une fois qu'on aura viré le Cartel de la Terre et que les choses seront revenues à la normale.
<clr:255,190,255>Comment t'as rencontré mon père, au fait ?<sb>Vous travailliez tous les deux à Black Mesa, je crois ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oui. Enfin, non.<sb>Pas facile de se faire embaucher là.<sb>J'ai eu des entretiens à Black Mesa.<sb>Ils ont dit : « Réessayez dans un an. »<sb>Je n'ai pas besoin de te dire ce qui s'est passé après ça.<sb>J'ai eu un sacré coup de chance, c'est moi qui te le dis.<sb>Il n'y a pas eu beaucoup de survivants.<sb>Honnêtement, c'est un miracle que ton père et toi, vous vous en soyez sortis.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh ! Euh
tu as besoin d'être seule une minute ?<sb>Parce que je peux, enfin, je peux
je peux mettre en pause la transmission
<clr:255,190,255>Je jette juste un coup d'
il, Russ.
<clr:255,190,255>J'imagine que la zone de quarantaine est derrière cette porte.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oui, oui, c'est là qu'elle commence.
<clr:255,190,255>Je vais chercher un panneau de contrôle pour l'ouvrir.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Si j'étais le Cartel, où est-ce que je mettrais un panneau de contrôle ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Voilà le panneau de contrôle.<sb>Ils ont probablement brouillé le circuit.<sb>Mais sachant que personne n'est assez stupide pour ouvrir la porte, ça ne devrait pas être bien difficile à remettre en marche.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>À ton avis, c'est quoi ?
<clr:255,190,255>Je pense
que c'est une sorte de serrure.
<clr:255,190,255>Et voilà le travail !
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Génial ! C'est ouvert ! Enfin !
<clr:255,190,255>Je vais entrer.<cr>À quelle distance se trouve la jonction Fairview ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tu vas traverser les anciens tunnels du métro sur ta route vers la gare de triage.
<clr:255,190,255>Est-ce qu'ils ont commencé à déplacer papa ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Je ne crois pas.<sb>Ce qui est une bonne nouvelle parce que nous avons encore du temps.
<clr:255,190,255>Oh, super.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ou bien c'est une mauvaise nouvelle parce qu'ils l'ont déjà tué.<sb>Et on n'a pas besoin de déplacer un cadavre.<sb>Il suffit de l'enterrer.<sb>Ou de le bruler.<sb>T'es toujours là, Alyx ?
<clr:255,190,255>Mm-hmm.
<clr:255,190,255>Tu sais, Russell, maintenant que je suis en marche vers la zone de quarantaine
<sb>Je viens de réaliser : je ne sais <I>rien<I> sur cette zone.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>En fait, le mot quarantaine vient de l'italien « quaranta giorni ».<sb>Hum, ce qui signifie 40 jours
<sb>Ça représente le nombre de jours pendant lesquels l'équipage d'un bateau devait être isolé avant de pouvoir débarquer pendant la peste noire.
<clr:255,190,255>Je vois. Cool.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh, non.
<clr:255,190,255>Je crois qu'on vient de se faire enfermer.
<clr:255,190,255>Hé, Russell.<sb>Je viens de trouver une seringue de je ne sais quoi qui trainait.<sb>C'est un médicament ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Est-ce qu'il y a une tête de mort dessus ?
<clr:255,190,255>Je n'en vois pas.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Probablement un médicament, alors.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx ! Est-ce que tu viens de t'injecter quelque chose que tu as ramassé par terre ?
<clr:255,190,255>Je me sens SUPER BIEN.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ah oui ? OK. Bien.<sb>Alors
Expérience réussie.<sb>Ouvre l'

<clr:255,190,255>Comment ça ?
<HEADSET><clr:255,208,172>Si je comprends bien, ils ont traqué cette chose jusqu'à un vieil immeuble résidentiel dans la ZQ.<sb>Mais, au lieu d'aller la récupérer, ils ont pris l'immeuble tout entier et ont construit une chambre forte tout autour.

Bonjour, je m'appelle Gabe Newell,<cr>bienvenue dans <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Dire que ce projet était un défi serait<cr>un euphémisme :<sb>c'est notre premier jeu <I>Half-Life<I><cr>depuis plus de dix ans<sb>et notre premier titre en réalité virtuelle.<sb>En plus de proposer une expérience VR incroyable<sb>dans un jeu <I>Half-Life<I>, nous voulions que<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> donne des réponses<sb>aux joueurs qui se demandent ce qui se passe<cr>après l'Épisode 2, et que, dans le même temps,<sb>ce soit un épisode accessible pour tous ceux<sb>qui n'ont jamais joué à <I>Half-Life<I> de leur vie.<sb>En fin de compte, à vous de décider si nous<cr>avons atteint notre objectif ou non, <sb>mais nous espérons que ce mode commenté<sb>vous donnera un aperçu des problèmes que nous avons rencontrés et des stratégies employées pour<sb>les résoudre. Pour écouter les commentaires,<cr>prenez l'hologramme de casque qui se trouve<sb>devant vous et mettez-le simplement sur votre tête.<sb>Une fois que vous avez écouté les commentaires,<sb>vous pouvez retirer le casque<cr>ou simplement utiliser le suivant.<sb>Merci de m'envoyer vos retours et impressions.<sb>Contactez-moi à l'adresse gaben@valvesoftware.com.<sb>Je ne peux pas répondre<cr>à tous les e-mails que je reçois,<sb>mais je les lis tous<sb>car nous nous basons essentiellement sur ces retours pour évaluer notre travail.<sb>Merci et amusez-vous bien !
Comme dans tous les titres <I>Half-Life<I>,<cr>il faut fournir dans la première heure d'<I>Alyx<I> <sb> beaucoup d'informations au joueur, autant que possible de façon naturelle et divertissante.<sb>Le joueur a besoin de savoir qui il est,<cr>où il est, dans quel type<sb>de monde il se trouve et qui sont les autres personnages et factions, entre autres.<sb>En même temps, il doit apprendre à jouer au jeu.<sb>Comment se déplacer ? Avec quoi<cr>peut-on interagir et comment ?<cr>Que faut-il essayer de faire ? Etc.<sb>Dans ces deux premiers niveaux,<cr>il nous a fallu plus de deux ans de tests<sb>pour déterminer exactement quelles informations<cr>on devait faire passer et comment.<sb>Il est tentant d'essayer d'inclure<cr>tout ce qu'on pense qu'un joueur<sb>doit savoir, mais il y a une échelle de priorités<cr>dans l'information. Plus on en met,<sb>plus on augmente les chances<cr>que le joueur rate un élément<sb>important car il est distrait ou<cr>perturbé par quelque chose<sb>de moins important. C'est pourquoi,<cr>dans les deux prochains niveaux,<sb>nous utiliserons des points de commentaires<cr>pour parler des endroits<sb>spécifiques où il a fallu se creuser la tête pour transmettre des informations au joueur.<sb>Entre ces commentaires, vous repérerez probablement de nombreux autres<sb>exemples pour les joueurs qui s'intéressent<cr>aux détails et veulent en savoir davantage.
Une des informations importantes qu'on s'est<cr>efforcés de transmettre est le moment exact<sb>où <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> se déroule dans la<cr>chronologie de la série.<sb>On a essayé de l'insérer dans de nombreux<sb>détails de l'environnement, mais elle n'a<cr>jamais été perçue dans 100 % des tests.<sb>En fin de compte, on s'est dit qu'elle était<cr>trop importante pour laisser les joueurs<sb>la découvrir par eux-mêmes. On l'a<sb>donc intégrée dans le texte déroulant<cr>introductif. L'état d'inachèvement de la<cr>Citadelle nous a donné l'opportunité de<sb>souligner visuellement la chronologie tôt<cr>dans le jeu.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> se déroule cinq ans avant<cr>les événements de <I>Half-Life 2<I>, dans lequel<sb>l'immense Citadelle représente le siège<cr>du pouvoir du Cartel.<sb>Toutefois, comme on peut le voir ici,<cr>son infrastructure en chantier est un<sb>désordre de câbles et de structures étranges<cr>qui s'étend sur toute la ville autour<sb>de la Citadelle. Elle permet de bien<cr>situer l'action du jeu dans le temps.<sb>On a essayé de renforcer cette impression<cr>à d'autres endroits dans le niveau suivant.<sb>L'architecture du Cartel tend à être<cr>abstraite en termes d'échelle et de forme, <sb>c'est pourquoi on y a inclus des clichés<cr>visuels des constructions humaines :<sb>de grands échafaudages en extérieur,<sb>des étages visibles, des rangées de petites<cr>lumières et une silhouette constituée<sb>d'éléments verticaux plus structurés.<cr>L'objectif était de trouver l'équilibre entre<sb>l'impression d'un édifice extraterrestre<cr>et l'aspect familier des constructions<sb>terrestres pour mieux comprendre<cr>sa taille et son état.<sb>Les grands panoramas comme celui-ci ont<cr>présenté de véritables défis en réalité virtuelle.<sb>En raison de leur distance par rapport<cr>au joueur, ils ne bénéficient pas de la <sb>vision stéréoscopique comme les objets<cr>plus petits en gros plan.<sb>C'est ce qui explique que les petits objets<cr>sur le balcon attirent souvent l'attention<sb>du joueur avant même que celui-ci n'ait pu<sb>remarquer la structure imposante au loin.<sb>Si on avait trop rapproché la Citadelle,<cr>elle aurait été ridiculement grande et difficile<cr>à cadrer.<sb>Posée seule sur l'horizon, elle semblait<cr>plate, en deux dimensions.<sb>La solution qu'on a trouvée consiste à<cr>remplir l'espace entre le point de vue<sb>et la structure éloignée par de nombreuses<cr>références d'échelle.<sb>La cité elle-même, les énormes câbles<cr>d'alimentation qui s'étendent jusqu'au<sb>point de fuite, les grands bâtiments<cr>homogènes du Cartel, le brouillard dense<sb>de la pollution, l'éclairage subtil et tous<sb>les éléments animés, en particulier<cr>l'hélicoptère dont le bruit monte<sb>progressivement. Toute la scène a été<cr>composée avec soin pour que le regard<cr>du joueur se focalise sur la Citadelle en<sb>premier lieu, avant de se promener sur<sb>les détails de la ville pour finalement<cr>se poser sur les objets attrayants du balcon.
Dans ces premières zones du jeu, on a<cr>rencontré pas mal de difficultés avec<sb>la densité et la hiérarchisation de<sb>l'information à transmettre au joueur.<sb>Les tests montraient que les joueurs en VR<cr>étaient facilement distraits, souvent à cause<sb>d'une meilleure vision périphérique, ce qui<cr>faisait qu'ils se concentraient sur<sb>un élément de la scène en ignorant les autres.<sb>Ce phénomène était particulièrement<cr>marqué au début du jeu, quand les joueurs<sb>se familiarisaient avec la VR,<cr>souvent pour la première fois.<sb>De plus, les joueurs progressaient à <cr>des rythmes très différents.<sb>On voyait des joueurs qui passaient<cr>30 secondes sur le balcon du début,<sb>alors que d'autres y restaient 30 minutes.<sb>On a donc fait beaucoup d'essais sur ces<cr>zones d'introduction, en changeant<sb>à chaque fois les informations que l'on<sb>voulait transmettre et l'endroit<cr>où on les plaçait.<sb>À l'origine, l'appel vidéo d'Eli avait lieu<cr>dans la pièce suivante du refuge,<sb>avec le snark et le caméscope, mais les<cr>joueurs étaient souvent trop occupés<sb>à interagir avec les détails de la pièce<cr>pour faire attention à la conversation<sb>entre Eli et Russell.<sb>On a donc placé l'appel vidéo sur le balcon<cr>du début, mais là, les joueurs ne faisaient<sb>plus attention à la vue sur Cité 17 et la Citadelle.<sb>C'était une époque où les joueurs<cr>découvraient encore des éléments de base<sb>dans le gameplay, comme les mouvements<cr>et les interactions avec les mains.<sb>Ce positionnement compliquait des choses<cr>simples. On se demandait, par exemple,<sb>quand donner au joueur l'info contextuelle<cr>sur les mouvements s'il répondait tout de<sb>suite à l'appel vidéo.<sb>On a fini par insérer la serre entre<cr>le balcon et le refuge, ce qui nous a permis<sb>de placer l'appel dans un endroit offrant un<sb>peu moins de visibilité et d'objets avec<cr>lesquels interagir.<sb>Ça a atténué les problèmes d'inattention car<cr>les joueurs n'étaient plus dans les premiers<sb>instants du gameplay, à tester le fonctionnement<sb>du matériel et les mouvements.<sb>En prime, on a pu ajouter des détails<cr>sur le balcon du début et dans le refuge<sb>d'Alyx sans risquer de détourner l'attention<sb> du joueur de l'appel vidéo.
En plus de fournir des informations<cr>importantes sur le monde du jeu,<sb>les deux premiers niveaux de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><cr>devaient également présenter certains<sb>avantages de la VR.<sb>Par rapport aux écrans plats, la VR donne<cr>un effet de proportions largement supérieur,<sb>et nos premiers tests avaient démontré<sb>qu'il n'y avait rien de plus impressionnant<cr>que de voir un strider de près.<sb>En plus du visuel, pour restituer pleinement<cr>les proportions d'un strider de près, <sb>il a fallu apporter un soin particulier<cr>au traitement audio.<sb>Les joueurs nourrissaient de fortes attentes<cr>en ce qui concerne le poids, la puissance et<sb>la présence du strider dans ses mouvements,<sb>surtout quand il marche sur le balcon<cr>où se trouve le joueur.<sb>Pour restituer cette puissance par le son,<cr>on a superposé plusieurs effets audio<sb>en traitant séparément les gammes de<cr>fréquences et la durée de chaque élément.<sb><wait:5>On a ensuite combiné ces éléments dans le<cr>moteur audio Source 2 pour les contrôler<cr>comme un seul et même son.
Au départ, c'est dans cette pièce, appelée<cr>« le refuge d'Alyx » en interne,<sb>que devait avoir lieu l'appel vidéo d'Eli.<sb>Mais après avoir placé l'appel sur<cr>le premier balcon, cet endroit<sb>nous permettait de résoudre d'autres problèmes.<sb>Dans la série <I>Half-Life<I>, on a toujours<cr>essayé de faire en sorte que l'histoire<sb>soit assez développée pour que tous les<cr>joueurs comprennent où ils vont et pourquoi.<sb>Mais pour les joueurs attentifs qui prennent<sb>leur temps, il y a d'autres détails qui<cr>peuvent leur donner une meilleure<sb>compréhension du jeu.<sb>Le balcon du début permet de se familiariser<sb>avec les commandes ; la serre fait office<cr>de point de départ de l'histoire ; et le<sb>strider apporte au joueur le spectacle, <cr>la surprise. On s'est donc dit que le refuge<sb>pouvait être un lieu tranquille permettant<cr>au joueur de découvrir des éléments plus<sb>narratifs dans son environnement.<sb>En même temps, ça pouvait être un endroit<cr>qui lui donne la possibilité de s'amuser<sb>encore un peu, maintenant qu'il s'est<cr>acclimaté à la VR.<sb>Passer du temps dans le refuge permet<cr>au joueur de se rendre compte du rôle d'Alyx<sb>dans la résistance et de sa place<cr>dans le monde.<sb>On voulait que cet endroit donne l'impression<cr>d'être une vraie planque où Alyx s'est cachée<sb>pendant des semaines, voire des mois pour<sb>faire des recherches sur le Cartel et<cr>préparer son coup.<sb>Le caméscope, le snark et le tableau blanc<cr>sont des jouets qui répondent précisément<sb>aux interactions et récompensent<cr>l'exploration en donnant aux joueurs curieux<sb>plus d'infos sur le monde de Cité 17<cr>et le rôle d'Alyx dans tout ça.
Les deux informations essentielles qu'il<cr>fallait que le joueur retienne sont simples<sb>mais pas si évidentes à communiquer :<sb>le joueur incarne Alyx Vance et non Gordon<cr>Freeman, le héros des précédents <I>Half-Life<I>,<sb>et contrairement à Gordon, Alyx parle.<sb>Ça peut sembler évident maintenant, mais ça<cr>ne l'était pas pour les testeurs avant qu'on<sb>décide de mettre ces éléments en avant.<sb>On voulait vraiment que tous les joueurs<cr>sachent qu'ils incarnent Alyx, c'est pour<sb>ça qu'on a souligné cette information à<sb>gros traits en intitulant le jeu d'après<cr>le personnage.<sb>Et même avec ça, on a fait en sorte que<cr>ce soit immédiatement confirmé dans <sb> l'appel vidéo d'Eli.<sb>Olga, le personnage introduit ici, a été<cr>ajoutée pour insister sur le message en<sb>interpellant le joueur quand il sort de<sb>l'ascenseur. Olga est le premier personnage<cr>que le joueur rencontre en personne.<sb>Le dialogue ici, et plus tard dans la ruelle,<cr>a pour but de faire comprendre<sb>au joueur qu'elle s'adresse à lui et<cr>que la voix de femme désincarnée<sb>qu'on entend est celle d'Alyx qui répond à Olga.<sb>C'est quelque chose qui était plus difficile<cr>à faire passer dans l'appel vidéo<sb>d'Eli car on avait Russell qui parlait<cr>hors champ, alors que dans cette scène,<sb>il n'y a clairement personne d'autre<cr>qu'Olga et le joueur dans la conversation.<sb>Sans Olga, on s'est rendu compte que,<cr>même s'ils avaient déjà parlé à Eli et Russell<sb>dans l'appel vidéo, les testeurs n'avaient<sb>pas l'impression d'être Alyx.
Quand on a commencé <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>,<cr>on était très curieux de voir comment la VR<sb>pouvait impacter le design de la musique.<sb>La série <I>Half-Life<I> a toujours utilisé la<cr>musique avec parcimonie pour laisser les sons<sb>d'ambiance créer l'environnement audio.<sb>La musique est un outil qu'on aime utiliser pour souligner les moments où l'environnement<sb>change de façon significative.<sb>Ici, quelque chose a alerté le Cartel.<sb>Lors des premiers tests de cette scène, sans musique mais avec une grande partie des<sb>autres effets visuels et audio, on a pu voir<cr>que certains joueurs ne comprenaient pas<sb>qu'ils devaient avancer, tandis que d'autres<sb>se laissaient distraire par les objets<cr>interactifs dans la blanchisserie.<sb>On a essayé d'ajouter une musique<cr>« d'action » très simple pour suggérer un<sb>nouveau seuil d'alerte du Cartel ainsi que<cr>la nécessité pour Alyx de se mettre<sb>en sécurité, et on a vu que les joueurs<cr>oubliaient moins facilement leur quête<sb> et qu'ils avaient tendance à progresser.<sb>On a gardé une musique assez simple et<cr>« cinématographique » pour qu'elle<sb>se fonde avec des bruits d'ambiance<cr>complémentaires. C'est comme ça qu'on a<sb>commencé à normaliser l'usage de la musique<cr>dans notre VR.<sb>Ce succès nous a encouragés à réutiliser<cr>la même technique dans des scènes similaires,<sb>plus tard dans le jeu.
La suite de ce niveau a pour but<cr>de continuer à informer le joueur sur<sb>le monde dans lequel il évolue, et de souligner<cr>la vigilance accrue du Cartel.<sb>On voulait aussi que la ville semble vivante, <cr>ce qui devient plus difficile par la suite,<sb>une fois que le joueur a acquis une arme.<sb>C'était assez difficile à réaliser à cause<cr>du défi auquel on est souvent confrontés : <sb>la friction entre narration et gameplay.<sb>Ici, si on suit la logique de l'histoire,<cr>Alyx devrait retourner voir Eli<sb>aussi vite et discrètement que possible.<sb>Mais en termes de gameplay, c'est le début<cr>du jeu, et les joueurs sont toujours<sb>en train de tester les limites de ce<cr>qu'ils peuvent voir et toucher.<sb>Comme on s'y attendait, les tests ont<cr>montré que certains joueurs suivaient<sb> immédiatement l'histoire et traversaient<cr>rapidement la zone, tandis que d'autres<sb>l'ignoraient complètement et exploraient<sb>l'environnement dans ses moindres recoins.<sb>S'il est tentant de supprimer tout ce qui<cr>pourrait faire distraction afin que tous<sb>les joueurs suivent le scénario, ça ne<cr>refléterait pas la densité de notre monde<sb>et le fait que le jeu compte récompenser<sb>les joueurs qui l'explorent.<sb>On a donc passé des mois à ajouter, modifier,<cr>supprimer des éléments dans cette section<sb>pour la peaufiner.<sb>On a essayé de trouver le niveau de tension<cr>narrative qui incitait le joueur à avancer,<sb>mais sans trop le presser pour qu'il puisse<sb>s'attarder s'il le souhaite.<sb>On a dosé les objets interactifs et<cr>les moments narratifs pour que l'exploration<sb>soit toujours gratifiante, mais les moments<sb>de distraction sont conçus pour être brefs<cr>afin d'encourager le joueur à reprendre son chemin.
Pour limiter les risques de cinétose provoquée<cr>par les déplacements véhiculés du joueur,<sb>on avait à l'origine écrit cette scène pour<sb>qu'Alyx se réveille après le crash du fourgon.<sb>Toutefois, les testeurs trouvaient ce passage décevant car ils avaient l'impression<sb>que le jeu occultait inutilement un moment<sb>palpitant qu'ils auraient pu vivre.<sb>Pour résoudre ce problème, il fallait donc trouver<cr>un moyen pour que le joueur puisse<sb>se déplacer en véhicule sans désagrément.<sb>Dans ce fourgon et dans le train à la fin de la carte,<sb>vous remarquerez que l'environnement extérieur<cr>n'est visible qu'à travers de petites fenêtres.<sb>Ces vues sur l'extérieur sont nécessaires pour créer<sb>la parallaxe du mouvement, mais grâce à la taille réduite de la fenêtre, le champ de vision <sb>du joueur est essentiellement occupé par l'intérieur<sb>du véhicule, qui constitue son cadre de référence visuelle.<sb>Ça diminue considérablement les cas de cinétose.<sb>En plus de la parallaxe de l'environnement extérieur<sb>on utilise un éclairage animé et des effets audio<cr>pour donner l'impression d'être dans un véhicule.
Alors que la carte précédente s'attachait à donner<sb>beaucoup d'informations au joueur sur le monde, cette carte est celle qui marque le début de<sb>la quête principale du joueur.<sb>Ça signifie que le joueur doit quitter cette carte<sb>en sachant ce qui est arrivé à Eli et<cr>ce qu'il va devoir faire pour le sauver.<sb>Le joueur doit également rencontrer Russell pour<sb>mettre un visage sur la personne qu'il entendait<cr>par radio jusque-là.<sb>Enfin, il faut aussi que le joueur récupère<cr>les gants antigravités et le pistolet,<sb>et qu'il apprenne à s'en servir.<sb>Ça fait beaucoup de choses.<sb>D'expérience, nous savons que si nous mettons<cr>tout ça dans une seule scène,<sb>le joueur ne se souviendra que<cr>de quelques points importants.<sb>L'importance de cette carte dans le rythme<cr>narratif est donc cruciale :<sb>elle doit séparer les éléments à intégrer<cr>et les espacer suffisamment dans le temps<sb>et sur la carte pour que les joueurs puissent<sb>les apprendre et les assimiler.<sb>Dans le même temps, le joueur est un peu<sb>sous pression. Les tests ont montré qu'à ce stade,<cr>certains joueurs jouaient depuis 30 minutes<sb>et commençaient à se demander quand<cr>ils allaient rencontrer des ennemis.
Une des premières choses que l'équipe<cr>narration a faite sur cette carte,<sb>c'est de développer une scène<cr>entre Russell et Alyx qui réunissait<sb>tous les dialogues dont on avait besoin.<sb>Étant donné que le joueur rencontre<cr>ici Russell pour la première fois<sb>et qu'il y a beaucoup d'événements<cr>dont les deux personnages<sb>doivent discuter, la scène contenait<cr>beaucoup de dialogues, finalement.<sb>On savait qu'on ne pouvait pas faire<cr>une scène aussi longue sans ennuyer<sb>le joueur, et que les infos les plus<cr>importantes allaient se perdre dans la masse.<sb>Une des solutions qu'on a utilisées<cr>pour résoudre notre problème est<sb>l'introduction du drone de Russell.<sb>Ça nous a permis de retirer des blocs<cr>de dialogue de la scène originale<sb>pour les répartir dans la zone qui<cr>se trouve juste avant.<sb>De cette manière, la scène elle-même<cr>pouvait omettre les préliminaires<sb>de l'histoire et passer directement<cr>à l'objectif principal.
En plus de livrer au joueur des<cr>éléments narratifs à un rythme acceptable,<sb>cette carte devait continuer<cr>à décrire l'état du monde hors de<sb>la zone de quarantaine.<sb>On voulait aussi que les<cr>joueurs comprennent quand <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><sb>se déroulait dans la chronologie plus<cr>vaste de <I>Half-Life<I> et qu'ils voient<sb>par eux-mêmes les dimensions gigantesques<cr>de la Citadelle en construction.<sb>La domination du Cartel se manifeste dans son<sb>indifférence envers l'humanité.<sb>Le Cartel a facilement conquis la Terre, et maintenant il la pille à ses propres fins.<sb>Il déploie un minimum d'efforts pour<cr>faire sa propagande, et en réalité, peu lui importe.<sb>Plus tard, dans <I>Half-Life 2<I>, on voit<cr>Breen qui tente de s'adresser à<sb>l'humanité avec un peu plus de sérieux, <cr>mais on ne sait pas très bien s'il<sb>s'agit d'une consigne émanant du Cartel, <cr>ou si c'est simplement Breen qui<sb>essaie de lui être utile.<sb>Quoi qu'il en soit, le développement urbain<cr>du Cartel est d'une efficacité brutale.<sb>Les câbles d'alimentation de la Citadelle<cr>se répandent de façon intrusive<sb>au mépris des habitants, tandis que<cr>le Cartel pille la ville de son énergie.<sb>Dans cette aire de jeu, clin d'
il<cr>nostalgique à <I>Half-Life 2<I>, un énorme<sb>câble transperce la peinture murale, <cr>ce qui montre l'absence totale d'intérêt<sb> du Cartel pour l'histoire de la ville.
Dans le laboratoire de Russell,<cr>c'est la première fois que le joueur<sb>se trouve dans la même pièce qu'un autre<cr>personnage, et ça met en évidence<sb>une des principales difficultés<cr>qu'on a eues en créant des scènes<sb>chorégraphiées en VR : faire en sorte<cr>que le joueur et les personnages<sb>gardent leurs distances.<sb>Dans les précédents épisodes de <I>Half-Life<I>,<cr>on pouvait toujours déplacer<sb>le joueur de force si on voulait <I>vraiment<I><cr>qu'il s'écarte du passage.<sb>On a essayé plusieurs fois de trouver<cr>une solution similaire en VR,<sb>mais on s'est rendu compte que<cr>c'était souvent désagréable ou que<sb>ça désorientait le joueur.<sb>Alors, on a conçu ces espaces pour<cr>créer une séparation naturelle<sb>entre le joueur et nos personnages.<sb>Là où on ne pouvait pas créer de<cr>séparation naturelle, on a dû empêcher<sb>le joueur d'entrer dans l'espace<cr>du personnage, et enlever cette limitation<sb>dès que le personnage libérait le passage.<sb>Une des autres difficultés était<cr>d'équilibrer le nombre de fois où<sb>les personnages réagissent à des<cr>actions du joueur lorsqu'ils sont en train<sb>de donner des informations narratives importantes.<sb>Dans les premiers essais,<cr>on a fait en sorte que les personnages<sb>s'interrompent en milieu de phrase,<cr>ce qui leur permettait de répondre<sb>immédiatement au joueur puis<cr>de reprendre leur texte.<sb>C'était techniquement simple,<cr>mais incroyablement difficile à réaliser<sb>sans que ça paraisse artificiel dans<cr>les animations et les dialogues.<sb>Les combinaisons de réactions<cr>personnalisées nécessaires pour répondre<sb>aux interactions possibles du joueur<cr>et reprendre le cours du dialogue<sb>narratif sont vite devenues trop nombreuses.<sb>On a fini par opter pour une solution<cr>qui ne permettait qu'un minimum<sb>d'interactions lors des sections narratives<cr>importantes, et un éventail<sb>plus large de réponses<cr>aux réactions plus complexes<sb>une fois la scène terminée.<sb>Dans le cas de Russell, <cr>on utilise des mouvements de tête subtils<sb>et des regards naturels pendant<cr>qu'il s'affaire tout en parlant à Alyx.<sb>Ensuite, après la scène,<cr>quand il tape sur son clavier, il répond<sb>au joueur qui essaie de le toucher<cr>ou de lancer des objets dans la pièce.
Dès nos premières expériences avec la VR,<cr>on a vu que les joueurs<sb>attendaient un haut degré de précision<cr>audio, même dans les interactions<sb>insignifiantes, surtout quand les sons<cr>sont censés correspondre<sb>à des éléments clairement visibles.<sb>Par exemple, dans un de nos jeux<cr>précédents, il aurait été acceptable<sb>d'utiliser une séquence générique<cr>de sons de touches d'ordinateur<sb>quand Russell tape sur son clavier.<sb>Mais en VR, on sait qu'un joueur peut<cr>observer les animations de très près<sb>et même approcher sa tête juste<cr>à côté du clavier de Russell s'il le souhaite.<sb>Dans ce cas, les joueurs remarqueraient<cr>l'absence de correspondance entre<sb>les pressions sur les touches et les sons.<sb>Pour <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, on a<cr>créé un ensemble de sons de touches<sb>individuelles déclenchés par l'animation.<sb>Par exemple...<sb><wait:2>Quand les doigts de Russell s'animent<cr>pour appuyer sur une touche, le son<sb>de la pression se déclenche, ce qui crée<cr>une synchronisation précise entre l'animation<cr>et le son.
Avec la VR, les joueurs sont souvent<cr>frustrés d'avoir à se baisser<sb>physiquement ou tendre le bras pour<cr>atteindre des objets dans le monde virtuel,<sb>surtout s'ils disposent d'un espace limité<cr>dans la réalité.<sb>Bien souvent, la solution consiste<cr>à créer un moyen de faire venir<sb>les objets au joueur au lieu de forcer<cr>le joueur à aller jusqu'à eux.<sb>On savait que ce serait une fonctionnalité<cr>importante de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>,<sb>étant donné ses niveaux immenses<cr>et la propension des joueurs à explorer<sb>les moindres recoins de l'environnement.<sb>On ne voulait pas que cette mécanique<cr>semble trop facile ou surnaturelle,<sb>c'est pourquoi on a décidé de l'intégrer<cr>dans la logique technologique<sb>du jeu, en en faisant une fonctionnalité<cr>des gants antigravités, qui sont<sb>les précurseurs naturels du<cr>pistolet antigravité de <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Ça nous a permis de présenter cette<cr>mécanique comme une véritable action<sb>physique rendue possible par une technologie<cr>de l'univers du jeu.<sb>Pour exploiter les fonctionnalités<cr>spécifiques à la VR, l'attraction<sb>des objets se fait par un geste physique<cr>au lieu d'un bouton, et on a ensuite<sb>voulu que le joueur attrape les objets<cr>au lieu de les placer<sb>automatiquement dans sa main.<sb>Grâce à ça, la mécanique<cr>devient plus naturelle et s'enracine dans<sb>la logique de l'univers du jeu. Le joueur, <cr>quant à lui, se sent plus puissant et efficace.
Quand le joueur attire un objet<cr>avec les gants antigravités, on utilise<sb>le moteur physique du jeu pour<cr>appliquer à l'objet une force de mouvement<sb>ainsi qu'une trajectoire partiellement<cr>affectée par la direction<sb>du geste effectué par le joueur.<sb>On définit la vitesse de mouvement<cr>de l'objet pour aboutir à un temps<sb>de vol standard entre son départ et<cr>son arrivée, pour que le joueur puisse<sb>développer un rythme qui finit par devenir automatique.<sb>On veut que l'objet arrive<cr>à la main d'une manière aussi fiable<sb>que possible, c'est pourquoi, dès qu'il<cr>se déplace, on le soumet à de petites<sb>impulsions constantes tout au long<cr>de la trajectoire (représentées par<sb>les flèches blanches).<sb>Ces impulsions permettent de contrer<cr>la gravité et de compenser<sb>les collisions avec les obstacles sur<cr>la trajectoire, tout en guidant<sb>constamment l'objet vers la main, <cr>qui est elle-même une cible mouvante.<sb>On utilise une zone de saisie<cr>permissive associée à un léger signal<sb>haptique quand l'objet arrive à portée. <cr>Ça nous permet d'être sûrs que<sb>l'objet arrive dans la main du joueur<cr>à chaque fois, même si son attention<sb>est concentrée sur autre chose.<sb>Un des autres avantages de ce système<cr>avec la physique, c'est qu'on n'a<sb>pas besoin de manipulation spécifique<cr>en fonction de la taille, du poids<sb>ou de l'inertie de l'objet, et qu'il<cr>compense automatiquement<sb>les différences de gravité que le joueur<cr>rencontre dans la chambre forte à la fin du jeu.
Dans nos premières expérimentations<cr>pour faire un <I>Half-Life<I> en VR, <sb>on avait déjà vu que les joueurs aimaient<cr>explorer l'environnement dans ses moindres recoins.<sb>Avec le réalisme accru de la VR,<cr>les joueurs voulaient interagir avec<sb>un grand nombre d'objets, mais ils<cr>espéraient aussi trouver quelque chose<sb>d'utile de temps en temps.<sb>C'était tellement universel chez<cr>les testeurs qu'en plus des endroits<sb>à fouiller et des objets interactifs,<cr>on a ajouté une nouvelle ressource : la résine.<sb>Les concepteurs de niveaux pouvaient<cr>placer cette nouvelle ressource dans<sb>des endroits amusants et<cr>intéressants qui n'étaient pas liés à<sb>la progression du jeu, afin de<cr>récompenser le joueur pour sa curiosité.<sb>On a aussi associé cette ressource<cr>à un objectif à plus long terme,<sb>l'amélioration des armes,<cr>afin de motiver davantage les joueurs<sb>à explorer l'environnement.<sb>Les recherches et l'observation<cr>minutieuses permettent ainsi d'avoir plus de résine<cr>à dépenser.
En interne, on appelle ce type d'énigme<cr>un casse-tête « électrique »,<sb>à cause de sa similarité avec un outil<cr>de détection électrique qui existe<sb>réellement et qui permet de localiser<cr>les fils électriques dans les murs.<sb>Les concepteurs ont développé cette<cr>mécanique comme un outil permettant<sb>de créer des expériences de jeu<cr>nécessitant que le joueur place sa tête<sb>et ses mains à des endroits précis.<sb>Le concept de base demandait<cr>simplement au joueur d'utiliser son outil<sb>multifonction pour pousser une boule<cr>d'énergie sur un parcours, comme dans<sb>les labyrinthes à billes pour les enfants.<sb>Si ce design simple incitait le joueur<cr>à placer sa tête et ses mains<sb>à des endroits bien précis, l'absence<cr>d'embranchements faisait que le joueur<sb>n'avait aucun choix à faire et<cr>qu'il n'y avait pas non plus de possibilité<sb>de conséquence négative.<sb>Pour corriger ce problème, on a ajouté<cr>les éléments de jonction pivotants<sb>qui permettent de relier les<cr>circuits. C'est le principal moyen<sb>d'interagir avec les casse-tête électriques.<cr>Si les casse-tête électriques<sb>gagnent en complexité au fil du jeu,<cr>le premier d'entre eux est conçu avec<sb>un minimum d'éléments pour<cr>familiariser le joueur avec l'idée que<sb>le courant passe dans les câbles,<cr>qu'il peut être redirigé en faisant pivoter<sb>les éléments de jonction,<cr>et qu'il permet par exemple d'allumer<sb>les lumières ou d'ouvrir les portes<cr>dans l'univers du jeu.<sb>La prise électrique qui fait<cr>des étincelles et qui se trouve en bas<sb>près de la porte n'est pas nécessaire<cr>pour ce casse-tête très simple, mais elle<sb>a été ajoutée pour montrer au joueur<cr>son fonctionnement car elle prêtait<sb>à confusion dans des casse-tête<cr>ultérieurs, quand on la voyait pour<sb>la première fois dans des<cr>configurations plus complexes.
Nos précédentes expériences de la VR<cr>nous ont montré à quel point un éclairage<sb>de haute qualité était essentiel<cr>pour créer une impression de réalisme.<sb>Dans la création d'un jeu,<cr>tout choix de technologie entraîne<sb>des compromis au niveau de la qualité, des performances<cr>ou du temps de développement.<sb>Pour <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, on a choisi<cr>une solution d'illumination précalculée<sb>de haute qualité et de haute<cr>performance nécessitant un prétraitement<sb>hors ligne assez important.<sb>On a réalisé le précalcul de<cr>la texture de lumière à l'aide d'une ferme<sb>de rendu, ce qui pouvait prendre<cr>plusieurs heures pour une seule carte<sb>à une qualité maximale, et on a fait<cr>notre maximum afin de limiter le coût de<sb>ce temps d'itération pour les concepteurs<cr>de l'équipe.<sb>Plus précisément, on a implémenté<cr>une approximation en temps réel<sb>du résultat final de l'éclairage,<cr>ce qui a permis aux concepteurs d'illuminer<sb>les scènes en temps réel avec<cr>la certitude que les textures de lumière<sb>seraient conformes à leurs attentes. <cr>La plupart des lumières<sb>de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> sont définies<cr>par un unique paramètre indiquant<sb>l'atténuation et l'ombrage sur la distance,<cr>ce qui nous permet de changer<sb>la luminosité et la couleur des<cr>éclairages en temps réel sans aucun coût.<sb>Cet encodage nous permet également<cr>d'appliquer les ombres des personnages<sb>et des accessoires dynamiques sans<cr>avoir à générer un rendu de géométrie<sb>statique en textures d'ombre.<sb>Nos textures de lumière stockent<cr>l'information directionnelle au moyen de<sb>l'encodage Ambient Highlight Direction,<cr>qui est une amélioration de<sb>la technique Radiosity Normal Mapping<cr>créée par Valve pour <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Ce nouvel encodage de texture<cr>de lumière garantit que les surfaces<sb>irrégulières apparaissent irrégulières<cr>même si elles ne sont pas soumises<sb>à une lumière directe.<sb>Cette source de lumière clignotante<cr>illustre bien la technique,<sb>car vous pouvez voir les détails<cr>des surfaces même aux moments<sb>où la lumière s'éteint.
Si le bernacle est une créature emblématique<cr>de <I>Half-Life<I>, il a présenté<sb>des défis intéressants spécifiques à la VR.<sb>Sa langue est conçue pour saisir<cr>les joueurs imprudents ou trop hâtifs,<sb>mais bien souvent, ceux qui tombaient<cr>dans le piège ne comprenaient pas<sb>ce qui leur arrivait.<sb>Ils étaient désorientés ou même<cr>victimes de cinétose quand le bernacle<sb>les soulevait pour les dévorer.<sb>Ces joueurs malheureux finissaient<cr>quasiment tous par mourir<sb>sans comprendre ce qui se passait,<cr>même après plusieurs rencontres.<sb>Pour régler le problème, on a recréé la langue avec<sb>un système de particules.<sb>Ça nous a permis à la fois de<cr>la simuler physiquement et de la placer<sb>de sorte à être bien visible.<sb>Si un joueur se fait attraper par<cr>un bernacle, la langue se place toujours<sb>sur son visage, quelle que soit<cr>la direction dans laquelle il essaie de regarder.<sb>De cette manière, il est presque<cr>impossible de ne pas voir la langue,<sb>qui sert également à guider le regard<cr>du joueur vers le plafond, où se trouve<sb>le bernacle. Le joueur sait alors<cr>où il doit tirer pour se libérer.<sb>Les effets d'asphyxie qui se produisent<cr>quand le joueur se fait soulever<sb>indiquent qu'il subit des dégâts,<cr>mais permettent aussi de limiter<sb>la cinétose en rétrécissant<cr>le champ de vision du joueur.<sb>Ces modifications, associées<cr>aux effets audio et à d'autres effets visuels<sb>comme l'évanouissement, ont éliminé<cr>la confusion chez les joueurs<sb>et nous ont permis d'intégrer<cr>cet ennemi classique dans le monde<sb>de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.
On a eu beaucoup de retours positifs<cr>sur nos premiers essais<sb>de rechargement du pistolet par<cr>une série d'actions physiques.<sb>Plus précisément : éjecter le chargeur,<cr>prendre un nouveau chargeur<sb>dans le sac à dos, insérer le chargeur<cr>et armer le pistolet.<sb>Les joueurs ont aimé apprendre et s'entraîner<cr>à faire ce geste.<sb>On a essayé d'utiliser un seul bouton<cr>pour éjecter le chargeur<sb>et armer le pistolet, mais on s'est dit<cr>qu'il était plus intéressant d'affecter<sb>ces actions à deux boutons différents, même si c'était une manipulation plus complexe.<sb>En fait, c'était plus intéressant<cr>précisément parce que c'était<sb>une manipulation plus complexe, car les joueurs se trompaient souvent de bouton avec le stress.<sb>Au début du développement du jeu, les joueurs cherchaient maladroitement<sb>leur chargeur ou l'éjectaient au lieu<cr>d'armer le pistolet,<sb>ce qui se traduisait souvent par un cafouillage.<sb>Pour les personnes qui observaient les tests,<cr>ça ressemblait à un ratage complet,<sb>mais les joueurs eux-mêmes considéraient qu'il s'agissait d'un des meilleurs moments de leur partie.<sb>En raison de l'aspect physique du rechargement<cr>et de l'entraînement nécessaire,<sb>les joueurs qui apprenaient la séquence de<sb>rechargement s'en prenaient à eux-mêmes et non<cr>au jeu pour leurs erreurs.<sb>Dans cette zone, on a placé des bernacles<cr>pour donner au joueur des cibles<sb>statiques qu'il peut abattre à son propre<cr>rythme et ainsi augmenter<sb>les chances qu'il ait testé au moins plusieurs fois<cr>le rechargement avant de continuer.
Dans les précédents <I>Half-Life<I>, quand<cr>le joueur incarnait Gordon, il a pu<sb>voir Alyx utiliser son outil multifonction<cr>pour pirater les systèmes<sb>de sécurité du Cartel et ouvrir des portes ou commettre des actes de sabotage.<sb>Cet épisode nous a donné l'opportunité<cr>d'utiliser les capacités<sb>de piratage d'Alyx dans des mini-jeux<cr>basés sur la VR.<sb>Tous nos mini-jeux de piratage sont conçus<cr>pour exploiter la détection<sb>indépendante de la tête et des mains<cr>qu'on retrouve dans les casques VR actuels.<sb>On a voulu encourager les joueurs à utiliser<cr>les deux mains simultanément<sb>et à bouger la tête, afin de créer<cr>une parallaxe pour comprendre<sb>les connexions spatiales dans les casse-tête.<sb>Ce casse-tête de casier reprend un de<cr>nos premiers prototypes, dans lequel<sb>le joueur devait utiliser un outil<cr>d'une main pour peindre un tracé<sb>sur une sphère tenue de l'autre main.<sb>Résoudre un casse-tête en VR en utilisant<cr>toute la liberté de mouvement<sb>des deux mains avait quelque chose<cr>d'amusant et d'unique.<sb>Dans sa forme la plus simple, la solution<cr>de ce casse-tête est assez évidente,<sb>mais la difficulté augmente progressivement<cr>tout au long du jeu avec l'introduction<sb>d'obstacles statiques ou mobiles, de tailles<cr>et de formes diverses sur la sphère.
Dans nos premiers prototypes, les joueurs pouvaient se soigner en prenant<sb>une trousse de secours de <I>Half-Life 2<I> et en appuyant sur un bouton de la manette,<sb>ce qui évidemment, n'était pas une interaction VR très passionnante.<sb>Pendant le développement de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, l'équipe de Counter-Strike<sb>a ajouté des injections de soins dans le nouveau mode de jeu Zone de danger qu'elle développait pour CS:GO.<sb>Quand on a vu ça, on s'est dit qu'un injecteur pourrait fonctionner comme<sb>un objet de soin intuitif en VR aussi.<sb>Les joueurs appuyaient sur un bouton pour armer l'injection, marquant ainsi leur intention de l'utiliser.<sb>Ça empêchait l'utilisation involontaire<cr>de l'injection et nous donnait<sb>l'opportunité de montrer comment<cr>l'interaction allait être physique par<sb>le toucher, l'animation et le son.<sb>Au début, certains testeurs étaient<cr>même effrayés par le fait qu'ils<sb>devaient se planter une aiguille et regardaient ailleurs en effectuant l'injection.<sb>Il a aussi fallu créer des approximations<cr>des bras et du corps du joueur,<sb>car les testeurs avaient chacun leur préférence quant à l'endroit où ils voulaient faire l'injection.<sb>On a même ajouté la possibilité de faire<cr>l'injection dans la tête,<sb>car beaucoup de joueurs essayaient de le faire simplement pour voir si ça fonctionnait.
Il a fallu s'assurer que les joueurs<cr>sachent parfaitement recharger<sb>leur pistolet dans les premiers niveaux du jeu<cr>pour que les combats ultérieurs<sb>ne soient pas excessivement difficiles.<sb>La carte précédente ne contenait que des cibles statiques sous la forme de bernacles.<sb>Le joueur pouvait attaquer les bernacles à<cr>son propre rythme, mais il y en avait<sb>assez pour qu'il doive recharger son arme<cr>au moins quelques fois.<sb>Ce premier zombie est bloqué<cr>derrière une porte grillagée<sb>et ne peut pas atteindre le joueur tant que<cr>ce dernier n'a pas tiré sur le cadenas.<sb>La position des zombies dans la section qui vient est pensée pour que le joueur réalise de nombreux rechargements et perfectionne son geste.
La réalité virtuelle donne l'opportunité<cr>d'ajouter de la physicalité au gameplay,<sb>mais il faut tenir compte de l'accessibilité<sb>et de la fatigue du joueur.<sb>Par exemple, on a essayé de mettre<cr>un plafond bas dans cette zone pour que<sb>le joueur doive s'accroupir tout au long du parcours pour monter sur ces wagons.<sb>Les testeurs n'ont pas apprécié le fait de devoir s'accroupir aussi longtemps, alors on a remonté<cr>le plafond.
Les panneaux de verre cassables de<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> sont un autre système<sb>conçu pour convaincre les joueurs<cr>qu'ils se trouvent dans un monde vivant.<sb>Les panneaux détectent la position d'un impact<cr>et génèrent de façon<sb>procédurale de nouveaux panneaux de verre<cr>plus petits tout autour du point d'impact.<sb>Ces nouveaux panneaux peuvent ensuite se briser et générer des panneaux plus petits, etc.<sb>On a vu que les joueurs cassaient<cr>souvent les vitres par accident<sb>et qu'ensuite ils « testaient » leur potentiel d'interaction en essayant<sb>de les briser davantage, pour finir<cr>par comprendre que oui, le verre<sb>se brisait bien aux endroits impactés.<sb>À un moment, on a essayé de créer des casse-tête spéciaux avec des vitres cassables,<sb>mais on a fini par se rendre<cr>compte que le verre fonctionnait<sb>mieux comme élément interactif passif de l'environnement, en réagissant<sb>de manière satisfaisante à divers impacts comme les attaques de zombie, les balles ou d'autres interactions physiques.
Les améliorations d'arme sont une nouvelle fonctionnalité de la franchise<sb><I>Half-Life<I>, et au niveau de l'histoire,<cr>cette mécanique collait bien avec<sb>le côté bricoleur d'Alyx.<sb>On a abordé ce défi de design en se<cr>demandant quelles sortes<sb>d'améliorations pouvaient avoir du sens<cr>et apporter une valeur ajoutée pour<sb>le joueur sans supprimer les interactions<cr>mises en place.<sb>La résine étant limitée, le système<cr>d'amélioration donne au joueur<sb>le choix de personnaliser et de développer<cr>son arme favorite, ou d'investir<sb>dans une autre arme pour qu'elle lui soit plus utile.<sb>Par exemple, le viseur point central<cr>nécessite toujours que le joueur vise physiquement,<sb>mais il améliore le feedback<cr> sur la localisation du point<sb>d'impact du tir et révèle les points faibles<cr>cachés des ennemis.<sb>Si certains joueurs appréciaient ce feedback<cr>et les nouvelles capacités<sb>de visée, d'autres n'étaient pas de cet avis et préféraient se concentrer sur<sb>des améliorations correspondant à <I>leur<I> style de jeu.<sb>Ce système permettait aux joueurs<cr>de dépenser leur résine sur<sb>les améliorations qui leur plaisaient le plus.<sb>Il y a un autre aspect des améliorations d'arme<cr>sur lequel on a travaillé<sb>et qui n'était pas forcément évident quand on a commencé à concevoir et tester le combat en VR.<sb>Le caractère plus physique des combats en VR peut réellement peser sur<sb>les capacités mentales et physiques de certains joueurs quand ils doivent<sb>utiliser les deux mains et bouger la tête dans l'environnement pour affronter leurs ennemis.<sb>C'est une expérience très naturelle,<cr>mais le joueur est aussi<sb>très sollicité par les rechargements et le combat.<sb>En observant les joueurs lors des phases de combat intenses, on a commencé<sb>à envisager des solutions pour faire<cr>en sorte que certaines améliorations<sb>diminuent le nombre d'interactions physiques nécessaires pour réduire<sb>la complexité d'une situation donnée.<sb>Le chargeur automatique du fusil à pompe<cr>en est un bon exemple.<sb>Une fois ce chargeur installé, l'action de chargement des cartouches,<sb>normalement lente et méthodique,<cr>est remplacée par une interaction<sb>bien plus rapide qui requiert simplement l'insertion des cartouches dans le chargeur<sb>automatique pour qu'elles soient automatiquement chargées dans l'arme.<sb>Ça permet au joueur de regarder autour<cr>de lui, de moins se concentrer<sb>sur son arme et d'être plus conscient<cr>de son environnement.
Au début du projet <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>,<cr>on s'attendait à ce que les joueurs<sb>souhaitent faire une pause toutes les 30-45 minutes, car c'est ce qu'on<sb>voyait dans <I>The Lab<I> et dans d'autres expériences VR moins ambitieuses de l'époque.<sb>C'est la raison pour laquelle on a conçu<cr>le rythme des niveaux du jeu<sb>pour qu'il privilégie des sessions de cette durée.<sb>Cependant, au cours du développement,<cr>le nombre de temps morts entre<sb>les phases de combat intenses dans le jeu a augmenté. De plus, les nouveaux<sb>casques VR ont énormément gagné en confort.<sb>En fait, au fur et à mesure que le jeu avançait,<cr>on s'est rendu compte que<sb>les joueurs adoraient jouer pendant des heures.<sb>À la fin des séances de test, les joueurs disaient souvent qu'ils n'avaient jamais joué aussi longtemps dans une session de jeu en VR.
Avant ce stade du jeu, le joueur n'avait vu que des crabes de tête accrochés aux zombies.<sb>Les testeurs qui avaient déjà vu<cr>les crabes de tête dans des jeux<sb>précédents s'attendaient à les affronter détachés.<sb>On a décidé de jouer avec cette anticipation<cr>en annonçant le premier<sb>combat contre une de ces bêtes<cr>par un crabe de tête qui jaillit<sb>d'un conduit avant de disparaître. On a aussi ajouté des bruits de crabe de tête,<sb>notamment un bruit menaçant venant de la porte partiellement barricadée, plus loin.
Dans cette zone, il y a deux types<cr>d'inscriptions sur les murs :<sb>les motifs de carrés et de points,<cr>qui sont les éléments fonctionnels<sb>du casse-tête dans l'environnement,<cr>et les peintures murales,<sb>qui représentent l'interprétation du Vortigaunt<cr>des événements de la saga <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Dans les premières années du développement, cette zone ne contenait que<sb>les motifs de points du casse-tête de perspective, mais à mesure qu'on<sb>développait le reste du niveau,<cr>on a remarqué que les testeurs<sb>appréciaient particulièrement les peintures murales du Vortigaunt sur le chemin de sa cachette.<sb>C'est à ce moment-là qu'on s'est dit<cr>que cette zone pouvait faire office<sb>de support pour accueillir l'
uvre majeure<cr>de notre Vortigaunt.<sb>Alors, on a placé l'ensemble des points<cr>comme une sorte de champ<sb>d'étoiles derrière l'
uvre du Vortigaunt.<sb>L'imagerie elle-même, qui s'inspire<cr>des pétroglyphes et d'autres formes<sb>d'art rupestre, décrit plusieurs<cr>événements majeurs de l'invasion<sb>du Cartel. Elle a été peinte à la hâte par<cr>le Vortigaunt blessé, comme s'il<sb>avait tenté de capturer les souvenirs fugaces<cr>de la vortessence dont il a été séparé.<sb>Le fait que les Vortigaunts entretiennent<cr>une relation complexe<sb>avec le temps nous a donné une grande liberté pour éviter de faire une chronologie linéaire rigoureuse.<sb>Par exemple, vous remarquerez<cr>que le Vortigaunt utilise des troupes<sb>contemporaines du Cartel pour représenter<cr>les invasions du Cartel dans le passé,<sb> ou que la chronologie est globalement floue. Il y a des éléments du passé, du présent et du futur de <I>Half-Life 2<I>.
De nombreux thèmes et motifs musicaux<cr>sont utilisés dans le jeu<sb>pour illustrer des éléments inexprimés<cr>de l'histoire et du contexte.<sb>Par exemple, les Vortigaunts occupent<cr>une place importante dans l'intrigue<sb>secondaire du jeu, et on a choisi d'utiliser<cr>une musique pour indiquer<sb>en filigrane l'aspect récurrent de leur rôle,<cr>à la fois dans la chronologie<sb>de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> et dans la chronologie plus globale<sb>de la saga <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Dans la musique de cette scène,<cr>vous entendrez des variations de thèmes<sb>utilisés dans toute la chronologie du jeu,<cr>des tout premiers sons<sb>au grand final dans la chambre forte.<sb>Ces variations représentent le chant des Vortigaunts emprisonnés,<sb><wait:13>l'extraction de leur énergie pour confiner le G-man... <wait:7>ainsi que le son<sb>familier qui symbolise la vortessence elle-même.<sb><wait:21>
Lors de nos premières tentatives<cr>d'écriture d'Alyx, on avait tendance à<sb>la faire réagir à absolument tout.<sb>Mais les tests nous ont appris<cr>que des interventions trop nombreuses<sb>de la part d'Alyx pouvaient en fait être agaçantes.<sb>Imaginons que le joueur soit dans un niveau particulièrement intense,<sb>rempli de zombies et qu'il s'amuse bien.<cr>Soudain, la voix d'Alyx retentit<sb>dans sa tête pour réagir avec colère, <cr>peur ou anxiété.<sb>Ces réactions d'Alyx créaient une rupture<cr>entre l'état d'esprit du joueur<sb>et l'état d'esprit du personnage qu'il incarnait.<cr>On en a donc enlevé une bonne partie.<sb>Les réactions d'Alyx qu'on a laissées<cr>étaient en général celles<sb>qui passaient à peu près partout.<sb>La réaction d'Alyx ici, au tunnel d'entrée complètement irréel du repaire<sb>du Vortigaunt, est un bon exemple<cr>car la scène est très différente de<sb>ce que le joueur a pu voir jusque-là,<cr>et il y a un effet de surprise.<sb>On a observé beaucoup de tests<cr>dans lesquels le joueur voyait ça<sb>et disait : « Holà, c'est bizarre. » Alors, on a fait dire à Alyx la même chose une seconde plus tard, presque comme un écho.
À chaque fois qu'on a fait des scènes chorégraphiées comme<sb>celle-ci, on a remarqué qu'il y avait<cr>deux types de joueurs : ceux qui<sb>s'identifient complètement au personnage,<cr>et ceux qui tripotent tout ce<sb>qu'il y a autour d'eux sans vraiment<cr>faire attention à ce qui se passe.<sb>Pour que les environnements soient amusants<cr>pour les fouineurs, on ajoute<sb>généralement des objets avec lesquels<cr>ils peuvent jouer.<sb>Comme cette scène se déroule sur deux pièces,<cr>on a pu ajouter un grand nombre<sb>d'interactions dans la première<cr>pour que les joueurs puissent<sb>l'explorer une fois que le Vortigaunt<cr>est passé dans la seconde pièce.<sb>Certains objets interactifs sont des jouets<cr>basés sur la physique comme<sb>les corps de crabes de tête<cr>et les ustensiles suspendus.<sb>Il y a aussi des animations déclenchées<cr>par les actions du joueur, comme<sb>les crabes de tête qui bougent quand le joueur<cr>les approche ou tire dessus.<sb>Sur la table, il y a un c
ur de crabe<cr>de tête qu'on peut écraser dans sa main.<sb>Il est issu d'une version<cr>plus ancienne de cette scène,<sb>dans laquelle le joueur ranimait un Vortigaunt blessé en pressant des c
urs<sb>pour en extraire le jus.<sb>Cette scène n'a pas fonctionné,<cr>mais on a trouvé l'expérience<sb>trop fascinante, et oui, trop <I>dégueu<I><cr>pour l'enlever complètement du jeu.
Le défi fondamental posé par des scènes dramatiques chorégraphiées comme<sb>celle-ci, c'est de réussir à divertir<cr>le joueur sans compromettre<sb>la transmission des informations<cr>de gameplay essentielles.<sb>Ici, le joueur doit quitter la scène<cr>en sachant que les Vortigaunts<sb>ont été capturés et qu'il va devoir chercher<cr>« l'Étoile polaire ». Cette scène<sb>particulière a connu de nombreuses<cr>variations au cours du développement,<sb>de la scène de cuisine avec un Vortigaunt extrêmement traumatisé<sb>à cette version plus humoristique.<sb>On a même tenté d'implémenter<cr>une interaction demandant au joueur<sb>de presser plusieurs c
urs de crabes<cr>de tête et d'en verser le jus dans<sb>la bouche du Vortigaunt pour le ranimer.<sb>C'était certes une interaction VR innovante et mémorable qui garantissait<sb>que le joueur était impliqué dans la scène,<sb>mais l'interactivité faisait que bien souvent,<cr>les testeurs se souvenaient<sb>des <I>actions<I> réalisées,<cr>mais pas des informations de gameplay essentielles.<sb>On a finalement abouti à cette scène humoristique, qui trouve un compromis<sb>efficace entre divertissement et réalisation<cr>des objectifs.<sb>Surtout, on a réparti la scène sur deux salles distinctes pour transmettre<sb>l'information en deux temps :<cr>dans la première salle, le joueur rencontre<sb>le Vortigaunt et apprend des choses sur lui, et dans la seconde salle, il reçoit son nouvel objectif.<sb>Cette séparation en deux salles<cr>semblait aider les joueurs à retenir<sb>plus efficacement les infos essentielles données dans la seconde salle.<sb>Si cette scène a subi de nombreuses modifications, il y a un élément narratif<sb>qui n'a quasiment pas changé depuis les toutes premières versions : le moment<sb>où le Vortigaunt jette une carcasse<cr>de crabe de tête au joueur en criant<sb>« Subsistance ! ». Dès le début, ce moment<cr>a eu un grand succès auprès<sb>des testeurs, et il est resté jusqu'à la version finale.
On a passé du temps sur tous les éléments<cr>de game design, à réfléchir<sb>à la manière dont le joueur devait apprendre leur existence et en comprendre les détails.<sb>Certains éléments de design sont tellement importants que le fait de<sb>ne pas les comprendre peut nuire à l'expérience<cr>de jeu. D'autres peuvent être<sb>de simples distractions amusantes ou<cr>des récompenses pour avoir exploré les systèmes de jeu.<sb>Chaque élément nécessaire demande un travail<cr>de notre part pour être enseigné au joueur.<sb>Dans <I>Half-Life<I>, nous essayons d'enseigner<cr>les éléments de game design<sb>d'une manière aussi naturelle que possible,<cr>dans le cours de l'aventure<sb>pour que vous n'ayez pas l'impression que le jeu s'arrête pour vous apprendre quelque chose.<sb>Nous n'y parvenons pas toujours, mais nos tentatives aboutissent souvent à quelque chose d'intéressant.<sb>Dans ce cas, nous voulons renseigner<cr>le joueur sur le crabe de tête blindé.<sb>L'élément principal qu'on veut qu'il comprenne,<cr>c'est que ce crabe de tête<sb>est invulnérable au niveau du dos,<cr>mais qu'il a un point faible sur le ventre.<sb>On veut aussi que le joueur apprenne<cr>que ce crabe de tête expose<sb>son point faible juste avant de bondir, mais pas uniquement. Le joueur peut aussi tirer dessus quand la créature se rétablit après un bond.
Enseigner les éléments de design<cr>des ennemis est toujours délicat.<sb>Les joueurs nous montrent depuis<cr>des années qu'il est très difficile<sb>d'apprendre quelque chose de nouveau<cr>quand on se fait attaquer.<sb>On a aussi compris que l'invulnérabilité<cr>est une caractéristique ennemie<sb>particulièrement difficile à expliquer.<sb>Si le joueur vide ses munitions sur un ennemi,<cr>bien souvent il ne fait pas<sb>attention au feedback des impacts.<sb>Si l'ennemi est vulnérable à certains<cr>endroits et pas à d'autres,<sb>le joueur peut réussir à le tuer en l'arrosant<cr>de tirs sans se rendre compte<sb>que certains tirs sont sans effet tandis<cr>que d'autres touchent ses points faibles.<sb>Alors, quand on a abordé l'entraînement<cr>du crabe de tête blindé, on savait<sb>que ça nous demanderait pas mal de travail.<sb>La première étape était d'éviter<cr>de mettre le joueur en difficulté<sb>en plaçant les ennemis dans cet espace grillagé.<sb>Ensuite, on a placé les crabes de tête au niveau du regard du joueur, leur point faible lumineux<cr>rouge exposé.<sb>Si le joueur en abat un immédiatement,<cr>il a droit à un effet d'élimination<sb>unique qui fait que l'ennemi explose<cr>en morceaux.<sb>Cet effet est conçu pour montrer au joueur<cr>qu'il a fait quelque chose<sb>de spécial pour tuer ce crabe de tête, par rapport à la manière dont il tuait ces ennemis jusqu'à présent.<sb>Il y a quelques autres éléments dans ce passage qui sont importants.<sb>Un deuxième crabe de tête est placé<cr>juste derrière le cadenas que<sb>le joueur doit détruire pour entrer dans la cage,<cr>ce qui l'incite à remarquer le point faible<cr>et à tirer dessus.<sb>Deux crabes de tête supplémentaires<cr>se baladent dans la cage. Ils sont<sb>scriptés pour attaquer des points invisibles<cr>sur le grillage.<sb>De cette manière, ils montrent constamment comment ils exposent leur point<sb>faible avant de bondir, ce qui permet au joueur de s'entraîner à cibler le point faible en toute sécurité,<cr>à l'abri de la grille.
Quelle que soit la section d'apprentissage<cr>en jeu, on a observé qu'il est<sb>très rare qu'une solution réussisse<cr>à faire passer le message à tous<sb>les joueurs ou que 100 % des joueurs quittent la zone avec la compréhension parfaite recherchée.<sb>Quand la compréhension du joueur<cr>est absolument essentielle, il faut<sb>trouver une solution plus contraignante qui demande au joueur de montrer<sb>qu'il a bien compris avant de continuer.<sb>Et c'est ce que nous faisons quand le joueur acquiert le fusil à pompe dans la zone suivante.<sb>Dans le cas du crabe de tête blindé,<cr>toutefois, les tests ont démontré<sb>qu'on pouvait se permettre<cr>de laisser passer quelques joueurs<sb>qui n'ont pas totalement assimilé la mécanique.<sb>Cette section leur donne l'opportunité<cr>de se rendre compte de ce qui<sb>se passe globalement, et les rencontres<cr>ultérieures avec les crabes de tête<sb>blindés consolident leur connaissance de l'ennemi.<sb> Pour ce crabe de tête, on a fait<cr>de nombreux essais de design pour que<sb>son blindage et son point faible soient visibles,<cr>et on a également ajouté<sb>une réaction spécifique aux tirs de fusil à pompe.<sb>Sur un tir de fusil à pompe,<cr>le crabe de tête blindé se retourne<sb>et gigote pendant une seconde,<cr>exposant son point faible.<sb>On a ajouté ça pour limiter la dépense<cr>de ressources qu'on pouvait voir<sb>chez les joueurs qui avaient encore du mal à comprendre la mécanique du crabe de tête blindé après avoir obtenu le fusil à pompe.
Une des difficultés qu'on rencontre<cr>toujours quand on donne une nouvelle<sb>arme ou un nouvel outil au joueur, c'est de s'assurer qu'il récupère l'objet avant de continuer.<sb>Dans ces situations, on cherche à mettre en place une sorte de « checkpoint »<sb>que le joueur ne peut franchir qu'en utilisant<cr>le nouvel objet.<sb>Ça peut être très compliqué dans les cas<cr>où on donne au joueur un nouvel<sb>outil qui ne change pas fondamentalement<cr>ses capacités. Pour le fusil à pompe,<sb>par exemple, quasiment tout ce qui peut être fait avec cette arme<sb>peut être fait avec le pistolet.<sb>En revanche, le checkpoint du pistolet,<cr>qui demandait au joueur d'avoir<sb>le pistolet pour pouvoir tirer<cr>sur le cadenas de la porte grillagée<sb>au labo de Russell, était simple<cr>à concevoir et à intégrer.<sb>Pour ce checkpoint du fusil à pompe,<cr>non seulement il fallait qu'on<sb>s'assure que le joueur avait pris le fusil,<cr>mais aussi qu'il avait<sb>appris à le charger avant de continuer.<sb>On a testé un certain nombre d'approches<cr>pour enseigner les mécaniques<sb>de rechargement en combat, et on s'est rendu compte que ça ne marchait pas.<sb>Quand ils devaient apprendre<cr>une nouvelle tâche complexe sous<sb>la contrainte, les joueurs reprenaient le pistolet,<cr>qui était un élément connu pour eux.
Une fois que le joueur a ramassé le fusil à pompe, il n'est qu'à mi-chemin de la validation du checkpoint.<sb>Ensuite, il doit apprendre à le recharger.<sb>Pour faire comprendre au joueur<cr>la nécessité d'apprendre à utiliser<sb>sa nouvelle arme, on a ajouté une menace imminente accompagnée d'effets audio<sb>et visuels pour la rendre convaincante.<sb>L'objectif est de donner au joueur<cr>la sensation que le temps presse, alors<sb>qu'en fait pas du tout : les événements<cr>se déclenchent quand le joueur<sb>charge le fusil à pompe pour la première fois.<sb>Une fois le fusil chargé, un bref compte<cr>à rebours se déclenche, au terme<sb>duquel les zombies entrent en fracassant les murs.<sb>Si jamais le joueur regarde les murs<cr>avant la fin du compte à rebours,<sb>ce dernier s'annule et les zombies débarquent.<sb>L'association du compte à rebours<cr>et du regard déclencheur est<sb>une technique souvent utilisée à des endroits<cr>où on veut que le joueur voie<sb>clairement un événement, sans qu'on<cr>puisse se permettre d'attendre<sb>trop longtemps que la progression reprenne.<sb>La destruction des murs par les zombies<cr>est la dernière étape permettant<sb>de valider le checkpoint du fusil à pompe.<sb>Utiliser de nouveaux ennemis pour ouvrir<cr>la voie au joueur quand<sb>ils entrent dans son espace est une méthode éprouvée, mais elle ne nous<sb>procure pas une grande satisfaction.<sb>C'est une technique un peu trop facile,<cr>qui sollicite assez peu le joueur.<sb>Mais dans une configuration comme celle-là,<cr>qui contient un nouveau casse-tête,<sb>une nouvelle arme et ses mécaniques,<cr>et une embuscade, on est déjà<sb>confrontés à une grande complexité<cr>de design dans un espace restreint,<sb>et des ajouts compliqueraient excessivement<cr>le scénario.
Le design virtuel du fusil à pompe présentait<cr>un certain nombre de défis.<sb>Dans les jeux, les fusils sont généralement puissants, et cette puissance<sb>se reflète dans la taille.<sb>Par conséquent, ces armes sont grandes<cr>et se manient à deux mains.<sb>Mais nos expériences avec les armes<cr>à deux mains en VR n'étaient pas aussi<sb>satisfaisantes que nous le voulions.<sb>Quand on tient un objet à deux mains<cr>dans la vraie vie, l'objet lui-même<sb>fournit une connexion physique entre<cr>les mains, et cette contrainte,<sb>en plus de fournir un feedback physique,<cr>permet aux joueurs d'arrêter d'y penser consciemment.<sb>En VR, sans cette connexion ou<cr>ce feedback, on s'est aperçu que<sb>les joueurs devaient sans cesse<cr>réfléchir à la manière dont ils tenaient<sb>leur arme à deux mains, sinon, elles prenaient<cr>des positions difficiles à gérer pour nous.<sb>Par conséquent, nos armes à deux mains<cr>demandaient trop au joueur de « jouer un rôle ».<sb>Dans <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, l'un de nos objectifs<cr>principaux était de permettre<sb>aux joueurs de s'immerger complètement<cr>en arrêtant de penser à ce qu'ils<sb>font dans la vraie vie, c'est pourquoi<cr>on a décidé de se concentrer<sb> sur un maniement à une main,<cr>y compris pour le fusil à pompe.
Notre premier réflexe avec cette arme<cr>était de reproduire un fusil à pompe<sb>classique, mais avec une crosse<cr>et un canon sciés pour qu'il semble moins<sb>encombrant tenu à une main.<sb>Cette approche aboutissait toujours<cr>à une poignée située à l'arrière<sb>de l'arme et posait un problème :<cr>l'avant de l'arme semblait toujours très lourd.<sb>Bien sûr, la manette VR en main<cr>ne reflétait pas ce poids, ce qui<sb>provoquait un décalage entre ce que le joueur ressentait et ce qu'il voyait.<sb>Le choix d'un positionnement plus central<cr>de la poignée, sous l'arme,<sb>nous a permis d'éviter ce décalage.<sb>À cause de ça, le centre de masse<cr>de l'arme n'est pas tout à fait<sb>respecté à mesure qu'elle acquiert des améliorations, mais c'est<sb>la première impression qui est la plus importante.<sb>Puisqu'on a choisi une forme inhabituelle<cr>de fusil à pompe, on a essayé<sb>d'utiliser des éléments visuels typiques<cr>du fusil à pompe partout où<sb>c'était possible pour que l'arme soit plus<cr>reconnaissable par le joueur<sb>et pour ancrer son design dans une forme de réalité.<sb>Un des éléments qu'on a repris est<cr>le magasin tubulaire qui stocke<sb>les munitions horizontalement, dans l'axe du canon, et on a réussi à respecter<sb>la contrainte de gameplay de six cartouches sans que le rechargement devienne ingérable.<sb>Le design de l'amélioration du chargeur automatique montre bien l'effort que<sb>nous a demandé l'augmentation de la capacité<cr>de munitions. Notre première<sb>mécanique de rechargement se basait sur<cr>l'insertion réaliste d'une cartouche à la fois.<sb>Les testeurs ont trouvé ça trop fastidieux,<cr>même si certains commentaires<sb>positifs disaient aussi que ça donnait l'impression d'être une star de films d'action.<sb>Le simple fait de permettre au joueur<cr>d'insérer deux cartouches à la fois<sb>a résolu le problème. Grâce à ça, on a gardé l'aspect positif tout en<sb>supprimant le défaut du design.<sb>Ensuite, on a eu envie d'accentuer<cr>la sensation « star de films d'action »<sb>et on a testé l'ajout d'un geste stylé<cr>que le joueur pouvait faire<sb>pour finaliser le rechargement.<sb>Grâce au mécanisme d'ouverture,<cr>on a pu intégrer une phase supplémentaire<sb>au rechargement pour que le fusil se distingue<sb>clairement des autres armes,<cr>et qu'il y ait ce petit mouvement de poignet<cr>jouissif terminant l'action.
Comme pour le fusil à pompe et le pistolet,<cr>il nous fallait un checkpoint<sb>pour la lampe torche afin de nous assurer<cr>que le joueur ne pouvait pas continuer sans.<sb>On a essayé un certain nombre<cr>de designs autour du moment où le joueur<sb>récupère la lampe torche, mais ils se<cr>basaient tous sur le fait que<sb>le joueur ramasse un objet, et n'étaient<cr>pas spécifiques à la lampe torche.<sb>La fonction première d'une lampe étant<cr>de fournir de la lumière, on s'est dit<sb>que le checkpoint devait être<cr>une zone plongée dans l'obscurité.<sb>On voulait aussi que le joueur<cr>soit content d'avoir la lampe torche,<sb>et pour ça, il fallait qu'il ait<cr>déjà l'expérience de l'obscurité avant<sb>de récupérer cet objet.<sb>Ça s'est révélé être un défi passionnant,<cr>car on avait déjà beaucoup<sb>de zones faiblement éclairées jusque-là,<cr>et il nous fallait une zone<sb>assez sombre pour que le joueur l'interprète<cr>correctement comme un checkpoint.<sb>La première chose qu'on a faite,<cr>c'est de s'assurer qu'il n'y avait<cr>aucune lumière dans le couloir.<sb>Malheureusement, le test a rapidement<cr>révélé que ça ne suffisait pas.<sb>Certains casques VR disposent de niveaux<cr>de noir extrêmement bas, et avec<sb>ces casques, cette zone éclairée<cr>renvoyait assez de lumière pour que<sb>les joueurs puissent avancer.<sb>De plus, notre brouillard au ras<cr>du sol fournissait juste assez<sb>de contraste dans le noir pour que les joueurs puissent distinguer la scène et la traverser.<sb>Même après avoir retiré le brouillard<cr>et la lumière indirecte de cette zone,<sb>on voyait encore des joueurs qui trouvaient<sb>d'autres moyens pour avancer.<sb>Certains d'entre eux tiraient de façon<cr>répétée, utilisant la flamme<sb>de bouche comme source de lumière.<sb>D'autres utilisaient l'interface de ciblage<cr>de téléportation pour éclairer<sb>la pièce, parce qu'à ce moment-là du projet,<cr>elle disposait d'une faible source de lumière.<sb>Finalement, on a désactivé la flamme<cr>de bouche dans le couloir<sb>et l'interface de téléportation a perdu sa lumière.<sb>La dernière étape consistait à ajouter<cr>quelques remarques de la part<sb>d'Alyx pour commenter l'absence d'éclairage et le fait qu'il lui fallait une source de lumière.<sb>Ça avait pour objectif de résoudre<cr>un problème de perception.<sb>Jusqu'à présent, notre jeu<cr>a appris aux joueurs que leur but<sb>est d'avancer, et qu'à chaque fois<cr>que leur progression est bloquée,<sb>c'est parce qu'il y a quelque chose<cr>dans la zone qui doit être résolu.<sb>Compte tenu de cette structure,<cr>il est tout à fait normal que le joueur<sb>fasse tout ce qu'il peut pour trouver un moyen<cr>de voir dans les ténèbres qu'il doit traverser.<sb>Le dialogue d'Alyx a pour but de dire<cr>au joueur que le jeu a reconnu<sb>ses tentatives de progression ici,<cr>mais que la solution est ailleurs.<sb>Par la suite, les tests ont révélé que<cr>ce dialogue, associé à la zone<sb>bien éclairée contenant des zombies<cr>sur la droite, aide le joueur à passer<sb>le couloir sombre pour progresser jusqu'à<cr>la lampe torche.
Comme pour les casse-tête<cr>de piratage et les casse-tête<sb>de l'environnement, les casse-tête électriques permettent souvent d'apaiser<sb>la tension des combats et de créer<cr>un moment de réflexion divertissant.<sb>Ce casse-tête introduit un nouveau type<cr>de jonction doté de deux entrées<sb>et deux sorties, ainsi que des circuits<cr>de branchement.<sb>D'un point de vue fonctionnel,<cr>il s'agit d'un simple « sas ».<sb>Une seule des portes du Cartel<cr>peut être alimentée à la fois, et la porte<sb>du plus petit côté, sur le chemin du retour,<cr>doit être alimentée séparément.<sb>En plus de créer une pause dans des combats assez intenses, ce casse-tête<sb>est un rappel de la mécanique car<cr>ça fait longtemps que le joueur n'a pas<sb>vu de casse-tête électrique, et les suivants vont commencer à gagner en complexité.
Dans les précédents jeux <I>Half-Life<I>,<cr>la lampe torche était fixée au corps<sb>du personnage, ce qui veut dire<cr>qu'elle éclairait toujours l'environnement<sb>selon le même angle par rapport<cr>au point de vue du joueur.<sb>Grâce à la détection des mains en VR,<cr>on a pu permettre aux joueurs<sb>de manipuler la lampe torche directement,<cr>et les testeurs ont réagi<sb>très positivement à cette nouvelle liberté.<sb>En fait, dans nos premiers essais<cr>de lampe torche pour <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>,<sb>c'était un objet qu'on pouvait tenir de n'importe quelle main ou même poser où on voulait.<sb>Ça permettait au joueur de placer<cr>la lampe torche quelque part pour qu'elle<sb>lui fournisse de l'éclairage pendant<cr>qu'il faisait autre chose.<sb>Malheureusement, ça créait la possibilité<cr>que le joueur abandonne<sb>la lampe torche derrière lui, ce qui était incompatible avec la progression de l'histoire.<sb>Faire de la lampe torche un objet à tenir<cr>empêchait aussi le joueur<sb>de tenir <I>autre chose<I> dans la même main,<cr>ce qui était une mécanique<sb>trop contraignante à gérer et trop punitive.<sb>Plus particulièrement, ça voulait dire que<cr>le rechargement devenait<sb>un cauchemar car le joueur ne disposait plus de main libre pour réaliser cette action.<sb>On a fini par choisir une lampe torche<cr>qui s'attache à la main libre<sb>et s'active ou se désactive « automatiquement ».<cr>Ça résout les problèmes<sb>de rechargement dans le noir et de perte<cr>potentielle de la lampe. De plus,<sb>ça permettait de ne pas avoir<cr>à utiliser de bouton d'activation<sb>de la lumière, ce qui est plutôt appréciable avec des manettes dotées de peu de boutons.<sb>L'allumage ou l'extinction de la lampe<cr>étant géré en fonction de<sb>la logique des niveaux, les concepteurs<cr>pouvaient régler différemment<sb>le compromis performances/qualité dans certaines<cr>zones du jeu.<sb>Si un joueur peut allumer sa lampe torche<cr>quand il le souhaite, le rendu<sb>de cette source de lumière qui génère des ombres doit être pris en compte dans le jeu tout entier.<sb>S'il sait que la lampe torche sera <I>éteinte<I><cr>dans une zone spécifique, le<sb>concepteur pourra utiliser l'économie réalisée<cr>au niveau du rendu pour<sb>augmenter le réalisme de l'environnement<cr>d'une autre manière.
Peu après avoir ajouté la lampe torche dans le jeu, on a découvert que<sb>les testeurs joignaient souvent la main libre<cr>à la main armée.<sb>Ils devaient alors orienter<cr>de manière inconfortable la main<sb>de la lampe torche pour aligner<cr>la lumière sur leur visée.<sb>On a donc décidé d'en faire un comportement automatique de la main libre<sb>à chaque fois que le joueur<cr>l'approche de la crosse de l'arme.<sb>En faisant ce geste, on peut voir<cr>que la main libre saisit l'arme<sb>d'un mouvement naturel et que la lampe torche s'aligne sur la visée.<sb>En fait, si vous regardez attentivement<cr>l'extrémité de la lampe torche,<sb>vous voyez qu'elle est dotée d'un joint à rotule.<sb>Ça lui permet de s'orienter si la main libre saisit l'arme.<sb>Le joint à rotule a quatre positions différentes :<cr>une pour chaque arme<sb>et une orientation neutre quand le joueur ne tient pas son arme à deux mains.<sb>Ces quatre orientations garantissent<cr>que la lampe torche est toujours<sb>pointée dans la bonne direction pour le joueur.<sb>En mode à une seule main, la lampe torche s'attache à l'arme avec une<sb>orientation idéale en toutes circonstances.
Quand les auteurs créent un nouveau personnage, on essaie d'écrire<sb>un maximum de choses en partant de la perspective de ce personnage<sb>pour lui trouver sa voix.<sb>Qu'est-ce qui le motive ?<cr>Comment est-ce qu'il parle ? Quel est<sb>son rapport aux autres personnages ?<cr>Il est utile de connaître les réponses<sb>à ces questions dans un projet,<cr>surtout quand on travaille<sb>en équipe et que plusieurs personnes<cr>écrivent pour ce personnage.<sb>L'histoire du « club sandwich »<cr>que raconte Russell dans cette section<sb>est issue de l'un de ces exercices d'écriture.<sb>L'équipe narration a écrit des pages<cr>et des pages de dialogues<sb>pour Russell. Il raconte à Alyx comment<cr>était la vie avant le Cartel,<sb>il s'agace contre elle, lui fait de mauvaises blagues, bref, ces dialogues<sb>illustrent presque tout le spectre des émotions.<sb>Quasiment tout ce que nous avons écrit<cr>pour définir le personnage<sb>de Russell a été abandonné en chemin.<sb>On a eu besoin de faire ce travail pour <cr>aboutir à Russell, mais tout<sb>ce qu'on avait produit ne lui ressemblait plus.<sb>Plus tard dans le projet, on a décidé qu'Alyx<cr>aurait peur du noir.<sb>Alors, il fallait que Russell parle beaucoup dans cette section pour tenir compagnie à Alyx.<sb>Peu importe <I>ce qu'il racontait<I>, il fallait<cr>seulement que ce soit à sa voix<sb>qu'elle se raccroche dans les ténèbres.<sb>Et ensuite, on s'est souvenu :<cr>« On n'avait pas écrit un monologue<sb>délirant sur le sandwich il y a un an ? ». <sb>Et c'est là qu'on a ressuscité le club sandwich.
Quand on crée un jeu <I>Half-Life<I>, on essaie<cr>de commencer les tests dès que possible,<sb>même si on ne dispose que de 10<cr>ou 15 minutes de gameplay.<sb>Pour nous, ça a été très utile de voir<cr>le plus tôt possible comment<sb>les joueurs réagissaient à ce qu'on faisait.<sb>Les tests ont principalement impacté<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> en révélant comment<sb>les joueurs réagissaient à la densité d'éléments interactifs dans l'environnement.<sb>Avant de commencer le projet,<cr>on se doutait déjà que les joueurs<sb>passeraient plus de temps à observer<cr>les détails de leur environnement<sb>en VR, mais on ne s'attendait pas<cr>à ce que ce soit à ce point.<sb>Voir certains joueurs passer 30 minutes<cr>à manipuler un simple objet<sb>interactif nous a vraiment ouvert les yeux.<sb>Suite à l'observation de ces tests,<cr>on a consacré une grande partie<sb>du temps de développement à l'environnement autour du joueur, et au niveau<sb>de détail et d'interactivité qu'on devait y mettre.<sb>Ça peut paraître étonnant qu'on ne<cr>se soit pas dit d'emblée qu'il fallait<sb>passer autant de temps sur<cr>l'environnement, mais la réalité<sb>du développement des jeux vidéo fait qu'on a toujours un temps limité<sb>pour créer un jeu, ce qui nous demande constamment de faire des compromis.<sb>Dans des circonstances idéales, on passe<cr>tout le temps dont on dispose<sb>à faire ce qui contribue le plus à l'expérience<cr>du joueur.<sb>C'est pourquoi les tests anticipés,<cr>qui nous permettent de mieux voir<sb>quels éléments contribuent à l'expérience<cr>du joueur, nous aident<sb>à déterminer où investir le temps limité dont<cr>on dispose.<sb>En l'occurrence, ces tests anticipés nous<cr>ont poussés à augmenter<sb>considérablement nos efforts dans les détails et l'interactivité du monde.
Les bernacles sont un type<cr>d'ennemi unique dans <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>,<sb>dans le sens où ils sont statiques<cr>et souvent situés au-dessus de l'angle<sb>de vue naturel du joueur.<sb>Lors des tests dans les espaces<cr>restreints ou faiblement éclairés,<sb>on voyait souvent les joueurs se prendre<cr>dans les langues de bernacles sans les voir.<sb>On a résolu ce problème avec l'audio.<sb>Plus spécifiquement, on a fait en sorte<cr>que les bernacles émettent<sb>des bruits de respiration,<cr>des grognements et des sifflements,<sb>comme dans la scène qui suit.<sb><wait:9>Ces sons alertent le joueur de la présence<cr>des bernacles, et donnent aussi<sb>l'impression que ce sont des créatures vivantes, toujours actives, et pas<sb>simplement des éléments de gameplay mécaniques qui ne font que répondre aux actions du joueur.<sb>La fonction de transfert relative à la tête<cr>(Head Related Transfer<sb>Function) de Steam Audio<cr>s'est avérée très utile, car elle nous a permis<sb>de spatialiser précisément les bruits<cr>des bernacles pour que les joueurs<sb>sachent que les sons viennent d'en haut.
Les premières versions des robots-lames<cr>étaient frustrantes à affronter<sb>en VR, car elles ne fournissaient pas assez d'informations audio sur leur position.<sb>Les robots-lames semblaient débarquer<cr>de nulle part et même une fois<sb>au contact du joueur, ils semblaient<cr>manquer de présence dramatique.<sb>On a essayé plusieurs superpositions<cr>de sons avec diverses atténuations<sb>sur la distance, mais ça générait<cr>souvent de la confusion, surtout<sb>quand il y avait plusieurs robots-lames.<sb>Notre solution ultime à ce problème<cr>était en deux parties.<sb>La première consistait à faire en sorte<cr>que les robots-lames émettent<sb>des sons d'alerte quand ils arrivent à portée<cr>du joueur ou quand ils sont<sb>déployés par un soldat du Cartel.<sb><wait:2>La seconde partie de notre solution<cr>consistait à ajouter des boucles<sb>de son plus agressives à courte distance d'atténuation.<sb><wait:4>La faible distance d'atténuation<cr>des boucles de son faisait que<sb>cet élément spécifique du traitement<cr>audio du robot-lame n'était audible<sb>qu'à proximité du joueur.<sb>Ainsi, quand le joueur entendait ce son,<cr>il savait que les robots-lames<sb>s'étaient lancés à sa poursuite et qu'un<cr>ou plusieurs d'entre eux étaient<sb>assez proches pour poser problème.
Avant qu'on ajoute les derniers détails graphiques, les joueurs<sb>ne mettaient pas longtemps à traverser les zones exiguës et sombres de ce niveau.<sb>Mais à mesure qu'on améliorait l'esthétique du jeu, les joueurs mettaient<sb>de plus en plus de temps à atteindre ce point.<sb>Comme on l'a appris au fil des années, passer trop de temps dans des zones<sb>souterraines mal éclairées peut fatiguer le joueur,<cr>et c'est un phénomène qui s'accentue en VR.<sb>Cette section en extérieur fournit un changement<cr>de rythme et un bref<sb>répit dans les environnements sombres.<sb>Non seulement elle donne au joueur quelque chose de visuellement différent<sb>et d'intéressant à regarder, mais elle lui permet aussi de voir clairement,<sb>d'évaluer la menace dans un espace ouvert et d'abattre quelques ennemis sans stress.<sb>C'était important de mettre de la diversité ici,<cr>car le joueur est sur<sb>le point d'entrer dans une zone sombre qui nécessite de la précision<sb>dans le tir et l'usage de la lampe torche.
Cette section, qui comporte de nombreux bidons explosifs dans<sb>la végétation xenienne, a été conçue pour changer les attentes du joueur et le rythme du niveau.<sb>Avant ce stade du jeu, les bonbonnes et les bidons explosifs étaient<sb>utilisés comme des armes offensives.<sb>Dans cette zone, ils sont mortels pour le joueur.<cr>Si un bidon ou<sb>une bonbonne explose, ça crée une réaction en chaîne fatale.<sb>Ce changement de priorité force le joueur à viser avec précision,<sb>ce qui ajoute de l'intensité au combat.<sb>Ça a un effet positif secondaire, qui est d'entraîner le joueur<sb>à utiliser plus efficacement le pistolet.<sb>L'alignement automatique de la lampe torche quand on joint les deux mains<sb>est pratique en combat direct, mais<cr>dans cette section, on a vu que<sb>des testeurs utilisaient séparément l'arme<cr>et la lampe pour illuminer<sb>et cibler les bernacles dans la végétation xenienne au-dessus d'eux.
Tôt dans le projet, on a décidé que<cr>les environnements de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><sb>bénéficieraient d'un éclairage volumétrique de haute qualité.<sb>Cette composante de l'éclairage est un outil indispensable, pas seulement<sb>pour créer une atmosphère, mais aussi pour attirer l'attention du joueur<sb>sur des éléments de gameplay essentiels.<sb>Notre système fonctionne en trois phases.<sb>Dans la première phase, l'éclairage provenant de sources statiques<sb>est capturé dans un clipmap volumétrique hiérarchisé en trois niveaux autour du joueur.<sb>Le niveau de résolution le plus élevé du clipmap mesure un pouce cube par voxel.<sb>Le clipmap est mis à jour de manière incrémentielle, moins d'une fois<sb>par image quand le joueur se déplace dans<cr>la scène.<sb>Dans la deuxième phase, un compute shader effectue une opération<sb>de ray-marching dans l'espace visuel à travers<cr>les clipmaps, accumulant<sb>l'éclairage statique, l'éclairage dynamique et l'extinction volumétrique.<sb>Le ray-marching est réalisé à chaque image et utilise un anticrénelage<sb>temporel pour améliorer la qualité.<sb>Dans la dernière phase, on rééchantillonne l'éclairage et la dispersion<sb>volumétrique de la phase précédente pour chaque
il, une fois par image.<sb>Le résultat est une texture qui décrit, quelle que soit la profondeur<sb>de l'espace visuel, la dispersion et l'extinction volumétriques<sb>qui s'appliquent lors du forward rendering.
On introduit toujours les ennemis à bonne distance, et jamais quand<sb>le joueur est soumis à des contraintes.<sb>Ici, le joueur peut voir des soldats du Cartel qui abattent quelques<sb>zombies errants, ce qui lui donne une idée<cr>de la puissance de ces troupes<sb>et de leur comportement au combat.<sb>On a placé le Cartel assez loin pour rendre plausible le fait qu'il<sb>ne remarque pas le joueur, mais assez près pour que le joueur puisse choisir<sb>de l'attaquer tout en étant relativement à l'abri<cr>d'une riposte.
La première rencontre avec un soldat du Cartel a généré un certain nombre<sb>de problèmes lors des tests.<sb>Le plus important d'entre eux était que les joueurs étaient souvent<sb>surpris que le soldat se mette à leur tirer dessus.<sb>Certains joueurs qui ne connaissaient pas la série <I>Half-Life<I> ne savaient<sb>absolument pas qui étaient ces soldats.<sb>De plus, à ce stade, les joueurs n'ont pas rencontré d'humain depuis<sb>des heures, et on s'est aperçu qu'ils étaient nombreux à ne pas vouloir<sb>ouvrir le feu tout de suite.<sb>Certains joueurs se demandaient également pourquoi Alyx était prête à tuer<sb>aussi facilement d'autres humains.<sb>Cette zone a été conçue pour montrer que<cr>les soldats du Cartel sont<sb>hostiles et qu'ils attaqueront à vue, le but étant de donner au joueur une raison de riposter.<sb>Ça commence par le dialogue qui précède<cr>la rencontre, quand le joueur<sb>entend les soldats du Cartel discuter du problème des pillards dans<sb>la zone de quarantaine.<sb>Ensuite, quand le joueur voit enfin son premier soldat du Cartel,<sb>il se rend compte qu'il est en train d'exécuter<cr>un pillard civil.
L'IA des soldats a toujours tenu une place importante dans la série<sb><I>Half-Life<I>, alors on était impatients de voir comment le passage à la VR<sb>allait impacter leur design.<sb>Nos premiers tests en VR contre l'IA des soldats<cr>du Cartel de <I>Half-Life 2<I><sb>nous ont tout de suite fait comprendre<cr>certaines choses.<sb>D'abord, les joueurs n'aimaient pas se faire tirer dessus, et ils avaient<sb>souvent une réaction négative viscérale.<sb>Les soldats fonçaient parfois sur eux tout en tirant, et on a compris que<sb>la vitesse des combats de <I>Half-Life 2<I> était tout simplement trop élevée pour la VR.<sb>De plus, en VR, toutes les actions prenaient plus<cr>de temps aux joueurs,<sb>surtout l'action clé qui consiste à repérer et à viser un ennemi tout en restant à couvert.<sb>Alors par rapport à <I>Half-Life 2<I>, les soldats avaient tendance à vivre<sb>plus longtemps en VR. Après ces premiers tests,<cr>il était clair que<sb>la réaction la plus courante de la part des joueurs était de s'abriter tout de suite des tirs ennemis.<sb>Alors, on a commencé à essayer de modifier l'IA des soldats pour créer<sb>une expérience de combat basée sur la propension des joueurs à se mettre à couvert.<sb>Nos premières expériences visaient à maintenir<cr>les soldats du Cartel<sb>à bonne distance du joueur, tout en faisant en sorte qu'ils restent assez<sb>mobiles pour que les combats ne deviennent pas trop statiques.<sb>Pour créer des moments de calme afin que<cr>le joueur puisse s'exposer, on a<sb>empêché les soldats de tirer en mouvement<cr>dans la plupart des cas.<sb>Pour empêcher les joueurs de rester statiques,<cr>on a créé un concept<sb>de « délogement », qui fait que les escouades tentent de déloger le joueur<sb>de son abri, et on a donné à chaque classe<cr>de soldat une technique<sb>de délogement spécifique.<sb>Mais même dans ces premiers tests, il était évident que les joueurs<sb>n'étaient pas capables d'affronter les soldats avant d'avoir appris<sb>à maîtriser un certain nombre d'actions de combat comme le rechargement<sb>sans avoir à concentrer toute leur attention dessus.<sb>On a donc fait attention à introduire progressivement les divers types<sb>de soldats, ainsi que les capacités spécifiques<cr>à chacune de leurs classes.<sb>Par exemple, ces premiers combats contre<cr>les soldats du Cartel ne font<sb>intervenir que les soldats de base,<sb>qui n'ont pas de grenade.<sb>Ça signifie qu'en fait, ils n'ont pas la capacité de déloger le joueur de son abri.<sb>On a pensé qu'il était important, dans ces premiers combats, de laisser<sb>au joueur le temps nécessaire pour apprendre<cr>à se mettre à couvert avant<sb>qu'on commence à introduire des ennemis capables de le déloger.
À ce stade du jeu, on savait qu'on avait besoin d'une scène posée ;<sb>d'un moment de calme pour récompenser le joueur d'avoir persévéré<sb>dans des tunnels sombres et effrayants.<sb>En plus, le joueur est en train d'arriver au passage le plus important<sb>de l'histoire jusqu'à présent :<cr>le sauvetage d'Eli Vance.<sb>Faire dérailler le train carcéral du Cartel qui transporte Eli Vance nous a<sb>semblé être exactement l'action qu'il fallait pour atteindre ce but tout en<sb>nous donnant l'opportunité d'insérer une scène spectaculaire en VR.<sb>On voulait créer l'impression de chaos générée par le déraillement<sb>d'un train en donnant au joueur un rôle actif<cr>dans la scène.<sb>Nos premières tentatives de conception du scénario ont été difficiles.<sb>Il s'est avéré que retenir l'attention du joueur n'était pas aussi simple<sb>que de s'assurer qu'il était dans la bonne position, en termes de gameplay.<sb>Dans nos premiers tests, bien souvent les joueurs rataient une partie,<sb>voire l'intégralité du crash ! C'est une<cr>des premières séquences<sb>de destruction qu'on a mises dans le jeu,<cr>il a donc fallu<sb>beaucoup travailler sur le comportement du joueur en VR et trouver comment<sb>le guider naturellement pour l'immerger<cr>dans le chaos.<sb>En plus de ça, pour respecter nos contraintes<cr>de fluidité, on a dû créer<sb>des événements en cascade afin que seule<cr>une partie de l'accident se déroule à la fois.<sb>Il a fallu coordonner précisément les effets audio,<cr>le design du niveau,<sb>les effets graphiques et les animations pour focaliser<sb>l'attention du joueur sur chaque étape de l'accident.<sb>Per exemple, au début du crash, on a utilisé plusieurs sons de train<sb>lointains pour inciter le joueur à regarder dans<cr>cette direction avant<sb>qu'un des wagons ne déraille pour aller percuter<cr>le mur en béton.<sb>À la fin de la séquence, l'effondrement<cr>de la cheminée permet d'attirer<sb>l'attention du joueur sur l'endroit où il finira par aller, et on a voulu<sb>qu'il assiste à sa destruction.<sb>Avant de faire tomber la cheminée, on a donné<cr>au joueur un bref moment<sb>de répit et, une fois encore, on a utilisé des sons pour attirer<sb>son attention sur la cheminée.<sb>Initialement, on utilisait un bruit de grondement avant l'effondrement,<sb>mais en pratique, on a trouvé que c'était trop subtil, et à la place,<sb>on a ajouté le bruit d'explosion qui attirait plus efficacement l'attention<sb>du joueur sur la cheminée.
Pour le sauvetage d'Eli, on a voulu créer un moment de tension dans lequel<sb>Eli est tout bonnement hors de portée du joueur.<sb>Mais pour que la suite de l'histoire fonctionne, Alyx et Eli devaient<sb>prendre des chemins différents à la fin de la scène.<sb>On a essayé différentes approches, dont une version dans laquelle Eli<sb>était suspendu à un rebord juste en face du joueur, et le joueur pouvait<sb>tenter de lui prendre la main pour le remonter.<sb>Mais en pratique, la main du joueur heurtait le sol dans la réalité.<sb>Non seulement ça empêchait complètement<cr>le joueur d'atteindre Eli,<sb>mais il avait du mal à ressentir l'émotion de la scène.<sb>Puisqu'Eli et Alyx devaient prendre des chemins différents, on a tenté<sb>une approche dans laquelle Alyx sauvait Eli, mais Eli se faisait blesser<sb>et ne pouvait pas continuer.<sb>Malheureusement, beaucoup de joueurs ne voulaient pas l'abandonner<sb>et restaient dans la zone.<sb>Finalement, on a opté pour la solution qui figure dans le produit final.<sb>Utiliser le sauvetage d'Eli par le Vortigaunt pour séparer Eli du joueur<sb>avait plus de sens et permettait au Vortigaunt de tenir sa promesse envers Alyx.<sb>Le datapod trouvé par Eli est un ajout qui nous permettait de réintégrer<sb>Eli plus tard dans l'histoire, et qui lui donnait aussi quelque chose<sb>à faire pour qu'il ait une très bonne raison de ne pas accompagner le joueur<sb>dans la suite de l'aventure.
On a commencé à expérimenter l'emblématique pied-de-biche de <I>Half-Life<I> assez tôt dans le projet.<sb>Les tests ont montré que c'était un outil intéressant à utiliser dans<sb>les casse-tête et dans les interactions avec l'environnement, mais nous<sb>n'étions pas très satisfaits des résultats en combat au corps à corps.<sb>On pensait qu'il était vraiment important que le pied-de-biche donne<sb>une impression de solidité dans l'environnement<cr>et face aux ennemis, ce qui a posé des problèmes<cr>de physique.<sb>Le joueur pouvait facilement planter le pied-de-biche dans un ennemi<sb>qui lui faisait face, car rien dans le monde réel ne pouvait l'en empêcher.<sb>Et en effet, sans feedback physique dans la réalité, on a remarqué que<sb>les testeurs gesticulaient tous de différentes manières.<sb>Certains remuaient la manette rapidement, d'autres engageaient<sb>tout leur corps dans les mouvements.<sb>En même temps, les résultats des tests de notre prototype de pistolet<sb>étaient très positifs, surtout au niveau de la mécanique de rechargement, plus complexe.<sb>Face à un problème potentiellement sérieux de R&D pour le combat au corps<sb>à corps, on a choisi de concentrer nos efforts<cr>sur le combat à distance.<sb>Le fait que les joueurs associent le pied-de-biche à Gordon Freeman et non à Alyx Vance n'aidait pas non plus.
Toute cette section de la carte, depuis le début<cr>du casse-tête de la carte<sb>d'accès jusqu'à cette pièce, a été ajoutée spécifiquement pour présenter<sb>au joueur la chambre forte.<sb>Sans ce petit détour, le joueur voyait pour<cr>la première fois la chambre<sb>forte à l'entrée de l'Hôtel l'Étoile polaire, c'est-à-dire au moment où<sb>il découvrait aussi la sous-station du Cartel<cr>pour la première fois.<sb>Ça faisait tellement d'informations nouvelles à la fois que de nombreux<sb>joueurs confondaient la chambre forte<cr>avec la sous-station,<sb>ou ne la remarquaient carrément pas. C'est pourquoi on a créé cette zone de la gare<sb>pour la mettre en avant.<sb>Les joueurs doivent entrer dans cette pièce pour obtenir la deuxième carte<sb>d'accès, mais malgré ça, ils ne voyaient pas toujours la chambre forte<sb>dehors, alors on a ajouté ce dialogue avec Russell qui demande à Alyx<sb>de regarder par la fenêtre.<sb>Ça peut sembler un peu lourd, mais il était nécessaire de résoudre<sb>le problème des joueurs qui ne reconnaissaient pas la chambre forte quand<sb>ils la voyaient plus tard dans le jeu.
On pourrait penser que le lancer est une interaction banale et simple<sb>en VR, mais pour qu'il procure de bonnes sensations, il faut le travailler<sb>et y apporter beaucoup de nuances.<sb>Et pour faire des casse-tête comme celui-ci, dans lequel le joueur doit<sb>lancer une grenade armée dans un conduit,<cr>le lancer doit bien fonctionner.<sb>Un jeu en VR classique fonctionnant à 90 images par seconde lit<sb>les données de détection de mouvement des manettes une fois par image.<sb>Ça signifie que les données sont lues toutes<cr>les 11 millisecondes.<sb>On peut penser que c'est un laps de temps très court, mais lors du lancer,<sb>le joueur peut facilement bouger sa main de 15 cm sur cet intervalle.<sb>De plus, le joueur peut laisser tomber l'objet en ouvrant la main ou en<sb>relâchant la gâchette à un moment de son geste.<sb>C'est pourquoi la reconstruction du lancer d'objet virtuel est un problème<sb>intéressant en matière de traitement du signal.<sb>C'est au logiciel de VR de déterminer l'intention<cr>du joueur à partir<sb>des données discrètement collectées par<cr>la manette, et des années d'expérience<sb>nous ont beaucoup appris sur ce qui fonctionne et ce qui ne fonctionne pas.<sb>Dans <I>The Lab<I>, que nous avons sorti en 2016,<cr>on récupérait les données<sb>de position de la manette toutes les 11 ms,<cr>et on utilisait les positions pour<sb>calculer la vélocité de la manette<cr>à chaque intervalle.<sb>On utilisait ensuite une moyenne de la vélocité et de la direction<sb>calculées sur plusieurs images avant et après<cr>le lâcher de l'objet<sb>pour déterminer la vélocité et la direction à appliquer à l'objet lancé.<sb>Si cette technique était assez fonctionnelle pour être intégrée,<sb>elle ne semblait pas toujours cohérente,<cr>surtout si le nombre d'images par seconde passait<cr>en dessous de 90.<sb>Par la suite, dans <I>Moondust<I>, la démo technologique des contrôleurs Valve Index,<sb> on a développé cet algorithme en prenant en compte des données de vélocité supérieures.<sb>On a également amélioré l'interface logicielle de SteamVR pour qu'elle<sb>fournisse les données d'accélération et de vélocité instantanée de l'unité<sb>de mesure inertielle du matériel, un calcul effectué toutes les 2 ms par la manette.<sb>Ça voulait dire qu'on n'était plus obligés<cr>de faire une estimation<sb>à partir des positions relevées par le moteur<cr>toutes les 11 ms,<sb>comme on l'avait fait pour <I>The Lab<I>.<sb>C'était essentiel pour créer une sensation de réactivité supérieure,<sb>car ça voulait dire que les calculs de lancer ne dépendaient plus<sb>de la fluidité du rendu.<sb>Suite à d'autres expérimentations, on a abouti à<cr>la solution utilisée dans<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, qui prend les dix images précédant le lâcher de l'objet<sb>et réalise une moyenne des trois images correspondant à la vélocité<sb>maximale du contrôleur dans cet intervalle de temps.<sb>On a découvert que ça donnait en général<cr>une meilleure approximation<sb>du moment précis où le joueur voulait lâcher<cr>un objet lors d'un lancer.<sb>Cette approche a abouti à un lancer confortable et cohérent, qui nous<sb>a donné confiance dans le fait que le joueur serait capable de lancer<sb>des grenades ou d'autres objets avec précision.
Ce casse-tête électrique facultatif a pour but d'apprendre au joueur<sb>à ne pas cliquer au hasard sur chaque élément de jonction sans en comprendre les implications.<sb>Ce casse-tête est conçu pour déclencher<cr>une alarme d'incendie si le joueur<sb>se contente de cliquer sur chaque embranchement électrique sans regarder plus loin.<sb>Un joueur observateur peut facilement résoudre<cr>le casse-tête sans<sb>déclencher l'alarme, mais un joueur imprudent<cr>la déclenchera, ce qui<sb>attirera un soldat du Cartel qui viendra vérifier l'origine du bruit.
Les joueurs passent en général deux heures maximum à explorer l'intérieur<sb>de l'Hôtel l'Étoile polaire, et on a vu dans les tests qu'ils avaient<sb>souvent du mal à se souvenir de l'objectif suivant qui consiste<sb>à neutraliser la sous-station du Cartel, plus haut.<sb>Dans des tests précédents, la chambre forte rappelait au joueur<sb>sa présence en émettant constamment un motif musical abstrait.<sb><wait:18>Ce motif fonctionnait tellement bien pour attirer et retenir l'attention<sb>du joueur qu'on l'a développé pour en faire un motif audio semi-musical,<sb>qu'on a utilisé dans la sous-station du Cartel pour représenter<sb>la collecte et la transmission de l'énergie vortigaunt à la chambre forte.<sb><wait:18>Dans l'hôtel, le joueur n'a pas de visibilité<sb>sur la sous-station, alors on répète cet élément sonore à différents volumes<sb>dans le bâtiment pour rappeler à la fois la sous-station du Cartel<sb>et la chambre forte à l'extérieur.<sb><wait:10>En fait, si vous regardez bien la végétation xenienne quand vous êtes<sb>dans l'hôtel, vous remarquez qu'elle réagit visiblement au débordement<sb>de l'énergie vortigaunt qui s'écoule<cr>de la sous-station.
Étant donné le nombre de bouteilles dans le jeu,<cr>et le fait qu'elles aient<sb>une telle importance dans le gameplay<cr>de la distillerie, on a décidé<sb>de rendre les interactions avec ces objets aussi intéressantes que possible<sb>en utilisant un effet de liquide procédural.<sb>Chaque bouteille dispose d'un niveau de remplissage aléatoire,<sb>et les valeurs qui déterminent l'agitation du liquide et la mousse sont calculées<sb>en fonction des mouvements de la bouteille.<sb>Ces données sont stockées dans la couleur de teinte de l'objet, qui est autrement inutilisée.<sb>Le shader calcule le niveau de liquide en fonction de l'orientation<sb>de la bouteille dans le jeu, car la quantité de liquide visible dans<sb>une bouteille semble différente si elle est en position verticale, inclinée ou à l'envers. On utilise donc différentes valeurs pour chaque position afin<sb>de conserver le volume apparent du liquide contenu.<sb>La surface du liquide est ensuite déplacée par<cr>un certain nombre d'ondes<sb>sinusoïdales, modulées suivant la valeur d'agitation afin de créer un effet d'ondulations.<sb>Les zones désignées pour contenir du liquide, contrairement à l'air, prennent les valeurs<sb>de couleur et l'indice de réfraction de ce liquide.<sb>Les effets de bulles et de mousse sont ajoutés en fonction des valeurs<sb>d'agitation et d'effervescence.<sb>Ces effets sont procéduraux et peuvent être modifiés pour générer<sb>de nombreux comportements différents.<sb>Plusieurs couches de bulles sont créées dans<cr>un espace visuel local<sb>spécifique à l'objet. De cette manière, elles restent stables d'une image<sb>à l'autre et peuvent toujours monter.<sb>Les graphistes peuvent définir un grand nombre de paramètres par liquide,<sb>comme la couleur, la luminosité, le potentiel moussant, les propriétés<sb>ondulatoires et même un ménisque à la surface qui incurve les rebords<sb>du volume, ce qui renforce l'impression de viscosité du liquide.<sb>L'environnement qu'on voit par réfraction à travers le verre et le liquide<sb>provient de la texture cubique d'environnement de la zone utilisée pour<sb>les reflets, et donc les bouteilles sont opaques et n'entrent pas dans<sb>le framebuffer comme le font normalement<cr>les objets transparents.<sb>C'était un choix de design stratégique, car comme pour le stockage<sb>des données physiques dans la couleur de teinte, ça veut dire que<sb>les bouteilles peuvent être rendues en lot,<cr>dans un ordre arbitraire, ce qui<sb>est capital pour le débit graphique.<sb>L'effet de réfraction des liquides permet de réaliser de nombreuses<sb>interactions dans une qualité particulièrement contraignante avec<sb>les contrôleurs à détection de mains en VR.
Dans des projets VR précédents,<cr>on a vu que les joueurs attendaient<sb>un haut degré de réalisme dans leurs interactions avec les objets<sb>de l'univers du jeu, et lors des premiers tests<cr>de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, on nous a<sb>signalé que les objets ne produisaient pas les sons auxquels on pouvait<sb>s'attendre étant donné leur matériau, leur taille et leur poids apparents.<sb>C'est ce qui nous a conduits, précisément pour ce titre, à une approche<sb>plus approfondie des sons produits par la physique.<sb>Par exemple, avant, on aurait utilisé un seul son physique pour tous<sb>les objets d'une certaine taille<cr>et d'un certain matériau.<sb>On aurait donc eu un son pour les collisions des petits objets en métal,<sb>un autre son pour les gros objets en bois, etc.<sb>Pour <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, on a créé une nouvelle bibliothèque de sons<sb>spécifiques aux objets, afin qu'il soit possible de faire la distinction<sb>entre différents objets similaires comme<cr>des couverts de cuisine<sb>et une petite canette en métal.<sb>Non seulement on a maintenant une bibliothèque de presque 2 000 sons<sb>physiques spécifiques à plus de 160 objets différents, mais on peut en plus<sb>modifier ces sons au moment de leur déclenchement en fonction<sb>de la vitesse d'impact et de la dureté<cr>du matériau percuté.<sb>Dans certains cas, on insère même des sons du contenu de l'objet, comme<sb>des allumettes dans une boîte d'allumettes<cr>ou de l'essence<sb>dans un jerrycan, qu'on peut entendre quand<cr>les objets sont secoués par le joueur<sb>ou qu'ils percutent violemment un autre objet.
L'exploration de la zone de quarantaine a révélé quelque chose de nouveau<sb>dans la ville : la végétation extraterrestre de Xen colonise la Terre<sb>et s'épanouit dans les ténèbres de City 17.<sb>L'équipe de développement appelait l'Hôtel l'Étoile polaire « l'Hôtel Xen »<sb>avant qu'on ne lui donne son nom dans l'histoire, car c'est<sb>le premier endroit qu'on a utilisé pour montrer<cr>la végétation xenienne<sb>et la manière dont elle pouvait envahir l'environnement.<sb>Une des difficultés rencontrées par l'équipe environnement lors du design<sb>de la végétation xenienne était de donner<cr>un nouvel aspect<sb>à un environnement existant sans devoir recréer des versions « xenisées » de chaque élément.<sb>Donc pour « xeniser » les scènes, on s'est largement appuyés sur le mélange<sb>de textures et le « kitbashing » de la végétation xenienne pour<sb>les modifications d'environnement importantes.<sb>On a aussi ajouté de nouvelles fonctionnalités dans Hammer, notre éditeur<sb>de niveaux, qui permet une manipulation plus créative des ressources pour limiter<cr>les redondances.<sb>Par exemple, on peut poser certains types de meshs<sb>comme les tentacules xeniens.<sb>Ils peuvent être placés, redimensionnés,<cr>étirés et manipulés<sb>pour serpenter dans un environnement, ce qui donne un aspect « fait main »<sb>sans avoir à créer toutes les ressources<cr>à un endroit donné.<sb>Ces éléments sont éditables dans Hammer et peuvent donc être ajustés<sb>à tout moment, mais on les a intégrés en baking dans les meshs statiques<sb>quand la carte a été compilée pour améliorer<cr>les performances à l'exécution.
La flore xenienne de cette zone s'anime en réponse à l'énergie<sb>vortigaunt qui émane de la sous-station<cr>du Cartel dehors.<sb>La sous-station elle-même n'étant pas visible<cr>de l'intérieur de l'hôtel,<sb>il était important de continuer à rappeler au joueur sa présence à l'aide<sb>de signaux audio et visuels, et la flore xenienne nous a donné le moyen idéal de le faire.<sb>Les shaders utilisés sur la flore<cr>xenienne permettent d'illustrer<sb>de différentes manières la réaction des plantes à l'énergie qui circule.<sb>Par exemple, les villosités et les cils s'étirent et vibrent, tandis que<sb>d'autres plantes palpitent ou luisent.<sb>L'intensité et le timing de ces effets sont<cr>calés directement<sb>sur les sons, ce qui veut dire que les rappels audio et visuels des palpitations<sb>de la sous-station du Cartel sont toujours synchronisés.
On a eu l'idée du raviveur, un des nouveaux types d'ennemis introduits<sb>dans <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, en observant que les testeurs aimaient fouiller<sb>l'environnement en VR beaucoup plus que<cr>dans les jeux traditionnels.<sb>On récompensait déjà l'envie de fouiller<cr>par des munitions<sb>et de la résine, mais on s'est demandé<cr>comment l'intégrer<sb>dans le combat, avec un ennemi.<sb>Alors, on a commencé à créer une variante du crabe de tête baptisée<sb>« runner », en modifiant son comportement pour qu'il fuie et se cache<sb>du joueur après avoir attaqué.<sb>On s'est rendu compte que les joueurs aimaient vraiment traquer un petit<sb>ennemi qu'ils savaient caché quelque part dans un environnement dense.<sb>Ils aimaient aussi tirer sur un ennemi rapide, capable de passer sous ou derrière<sb>les objets du quotidien comme les tables<cr>et les chaises.<sb>Enfin, les joueurs nous ont dit qu'ils aimaient jouer le rôle<sb>de l'agresseur, pour changer, car partout ailleurs dans le jeu, ils avaient<sb>l'impression d'être sur la défensive.<sb>Les retours étaient globalement très positifs,<cr>mais il y avait<sb>un problème : comment encourager le joueur à chercher le runner ?<sb>Après quelques escarmouches avec le runner,<cr>on a vu que les joueurs<sb>comprenaient qu'ils n'étaient pas obligés de le débusquer. Ils pouvaient<sb>simplement attendre qu'il s'enfuie, et quitter la salle. On a donc commencé<sb>à travailler sur différents moyens de rendre<cr>le runner plus dangereux<sb>s'il n'était pas tué, et ainsi de mettre la pression sur le joueur, qui devait<sb>trouver le runner rapidement pour ne pas que<cr>la situation s'aggrave.<sb>Après quelques expérimentations, on a abouti au prototype de runner<sb>qui pouvait ranimer un zombie, et ainsi devenir<cr>un nouveau type d'ennemi,<sb>plus dangereux qu'un runner ou un zombie.<sb>Suite à cette modification, le runner a été rebaptisé en interne<sb>le « raviveur », et on a commencé à créer différentes situations avec lui.<sb>Il a fallu beaucoup de tests pour équilibrer tous<cr>les éléments des combats<sb>contre le raviveur, car ces rencontres se faisaient en trois étapes<sb>distinctes : le combat contre le raviveur, la traque du raviveur caché<sb>et le combat contre un zombie ranimé.<sb>Au bout du compte, on n'avait toujours pas<cr>le sentiment d'avoir trouvé<sb>le moyen infaillible de motiver le joueur à traquer<cr>le raviveur, alors on a<sb>transformé le c
ur de cette créature en une clé que le joueur doit récupérer.
L'animation d'un ennemi peut susciter une réponse émotionnelle très forte<sb>chez les joueurs, surtout en VR.<sb>En développant le raviveur, on a appris que parfois, les actions<sb>d'un personnage peuvent avoir des conséquences imprévues.<sb>Pour nos premiers prototypes de raviveur, on a simplement utilisé<sb>un modèle de crabe de tête teinté en bleu auquel on a ajouté<sb>des effets d'électricité rudimentaires.<sb>Le prototype a eu assez de succès dans les tests pour qu'on décide<sb>de créer un nouveau modèle de raviveur, avec<cr>une peau électrique et des effets améliorés.<sb>Les joueurs identifiaient bien le nouveau raviveur dans le jeu, mais on a<sb>rencontré un nouveau problème : ils ne voulaient plus le combattre.<sb>Si le crabe de tête bleu était facilement identifiable comme un élément<sb>dangereux, le nouveau modèle était quelque chose que les joueurs devaient<sb>évaluer totalement, et ils ne le voyaient pas nécessairement comme une menace.<sb>En fait, les animations créées pour le nouveau modèle de raviveur étaient<sb>interprétées par de nombreux joueurs comme amicales, ou même mignonnes.<sb>Les joueurs tentaient souvent d'approcher<cr>la créature pour la caresser,<sb>ou pire, ils refusaient de la tuer pour récupérer l'élément de casse-tête<sb>requis, ce qui bloquait leur progression dans le jeu.<sb>S'ils comprenaient alors qu'ils devaient tuer<cr>la créature toute mignonne<sb>pour continuer, ils étaient horrifiés d'avoir à le faire.<sb>Pour remédier à ça, nous avons réécrit la plupart des animations<sb>du raviveur afin de le rendre nettement plus inquiétant et menaçant.<sb>On a également rendu le raviveur plus agressif en ajoutant une attaque<sb>sautée si le joueur s'approchait trop près.<sb>Avec ces changements d'animations<cr>et de comportement, les joueurs<sb>affrontaient de nouveau le raviveur comme nous<cr>le voulions et ne voulaient<sb>plus en faire un animal de compagnie.
Cet endroit est la pièce qu'on peut voir au tout début de la bande-annonce de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Ce n'est pas un choix évident pour cet usage.<cr>La pièce est sombre,<sb>peu colorée et il y a un grand couloir.<sb>Les fournitures de nettoyage et les paniers de linge n'ont rien d'intéressant.<sb>Mais on a choisi ce scénario parce qu'il montre bien l'excitation<sb>et la tension, qui selon nous, sont caractéristiques du jeu.<sb>Toutes les bandes-annonces de jeux vidéo demandent un soin particulier.<sb>Transmettre l'expérience principale d'un jeu en quelques instants<sb>est toujours compliqué, même dans le meilleur<cr>des cas.<sb>Mais la bande-annonce de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> a nécessité plus de travail que<sb>d'habitude pour relever un ensemble de défis particulièrement difficiles et atypiques.<sb>Le développement du jeu était resté secret, alors cette bande-annonce<sb>allait montrer le premier travail de Valve sur un projet<sb><I>Half-Life<I> depuis 13 ans.<sb>En plus de ça, la bande-annonce devait communiquer en peu de temps que<sb>Valve avait choisi de faire le prochain épisode de <I>Half-Life<I> en VR.<sb>Et même si on était sûrs de notre décision de faire un jeu en VR, et de<sb>la qualité de ce qu'on avait créé, on avait quand même un peu peur<sb>qu'en annonçant ces décisions au monde, nos fans, même les plus fidèles,<sb>se disent qu'on avait complètement perdu<cr>les pédales.<sb>Ceux d'entre nous qui travaillaient sur la bande-annonce savaient<sb>qu'il fallait générer un enthousiasme suffisant pour dissiper les inquiétudes du public.<sb>La bande-annonce devait aussi indiquer clairement qu'il ne s'agissait <I>pas<I> de Half-Life 3.<sb>Ce qui signifiait que le jeu ne se déroulait pas après les événements de l'Épisode 2.<sb>Au lieu de ça, <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> était une sorte de préquel qui se passait<sb>entre les événements de <I>Half-Life<I> et <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>De plus, la bande-annonce devait montrer<cr>de la profondeur,<sb>de la diversité, des personnages familiers et suffisamment de nouveautés<sb>et de surprises pour faire comprendre au spectateur qu'il s'agissait vraiment<sb>d'un épisode à part entière de la série <I>Half-Life<I>,<cr>et non d'une petite<sb>expérience VR ou d'un spin-off.<sb>C'était une tâche difficile, mais toute l'équipe du jeu a contribué<sb>à l'effort car tout le monde comprenait l'importance de ce travail.<sb>Nous sommes tout aussi fiers du résultat obtenu dans la bande-annonce<sb>que de n'importe quel autre aspect<cr>de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.
<I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> propose au joueur trois types de déplacements. Continu, glissement et téléportation.<sb>Au début, une des propriétés de la téléportation, et dans une moindre<sb>mesure du glissement, faisait que les joueurs faisaient souvent référence<sb>à la mécanique réelle de téléportation lorsqu'ils décrivaient<sb>leurs déplacements dans l'environnement.<sb>Ils disaient par exemple « je me suis téléporté près du bureau »,<sb>ou « je me suis téléporté à couvert » pour décrire<cr>leur action, ce qui était<sb>une manière inconsciente de dire qu'ils interagissaient avec le jeu d'une façon spécifique.<sb>Pour corriger ce problème, on a apporté très tôt<cr>des changements clés<sb>qui ont considérablement modifié la façon dont<cr>les joueurs parlaient<sb>de leurs déplacements, et donc accentué<cr>leur immersion dans une réalité virtuelle<cr>plus convaincante.<sb>L'un de ces changements était l'indicateur visuel qui représentait la destination de la téléportation.<sb>On a remplacé l'indicateur cylindrique abstrait utilisé dans <I>The Lab<I> par<sb>une paire de pieds holographiques.<sb>Les pieds renforçaient le sentiment de présence physique et indiquaient<sb>la direction que le joueur prenait au point d'arrivée de la téléportation.<sb>On a également ajouté des pieds animés entre<cr>la position actuelle<sb>du joueur et la destination de la téléportation.<sb>Ces pieds illustrent le chemin emprunté par<cr>le joueur, ce qui renforce<sb>la représentation du déplacement dans l'environnement.<sb>En plus des changements apportés à l'interface graphique, on a aussi<sb>ajouté des bruits de pas et de mouvements<cr>du corps qui se déclenchent<sb>après la téléportation, afin d'illustrer concrètement<cr>le déplacement du joueur dans l'espace.<sb>Ce n'est pas quelque chose qu'on remarque forcément au début, mais ça<sb>devient assez évident lorsque ces sons sont retirés ou incorrects.<sb>Les bruits de pas ont changé la façon dont<cr>les joueurs décrivaient<sb>leurs déplacements. Après cet ajout, les joueurs faisaient de nouveau référence<sb>aux déplacements dans l'environnement en parlant de marche ou de course<sb>au lieu d'utiliser la terminologie du jeu.
Par rapport à nos expériences des jeux<cr>à la première personne, en VR<sb>on trouvait qu'il était parfois trop facile de créer<cr>une ambiance tendue.<sb>L'intensité peut servir le jeu, mais aussi le desservir dans les cas où<sb>on essaie d'apprendre au joueur une nouvelle mécanique.<sb>Dans les situations intenses, bien souvent<cr>les joueurs ne remarquent pas<sb>ou ne retiennent pas des informations importantes.<sb>Et par conséquent, on a souvent dû limiter volontairement la tension<sb>dans les zones du jeu où on introduisait quelque chose de nouveau pour le joueur.<sb>Ici, quand le joueur descend sous l'hôtel, les bruits du raviveur<sb>ont pour but de l'habituer à l'idée qu'il va rencontrer la créature qu'il a aperçu plus tôt en entrant<cr>dans l'hôtel.<sb>Le cri du raviveur et son ombre sur le mur sont conçus pour réduire<sb>la tension en indiquant la position de la créature plus loin, éliminant ainsi toute surprise potentielle.<sb>Le fait d'indiquer la position du raviveur et de donner l'avantage<sb>au joueur permet de préparer la scène de résurrection, dans laquelle<sb>le joueur voudra observer le raviveur au lieu<cr>de lui tirer dessus immédiatement.<sb>C'est important, car c'est la première fois<cr>que le joueur voit le raviveur<sb>réanimer un zombie. Et si le joueur est trop distrait pour voir la scène,<sb>il aura du mal à triompher du combat à venir.
Un des défis posés par la mécanique de résurrection était d'apprendre<sb>au joueur que la cible est en réalité le raviveur,<cr>et que le zombie<sb>n'est en fait qu'un véhicule inerte qu'on ne peut pas blesser.<sb>C'est quelque chose qui est assez différent de ce à quoi on a habitué le joueur.<sb>Avant ce stade du jeu, les joueurs voyaient<cr>un zombie et devaient<sb>tirer dessus jusqu'à ce qu'il meure.<sb>Le raviveur brise cette attente et, lors des premiers tests, les joueurs<sb>pensaient que le jeu buguait quand le zombie ne mourait pas,<sb>ou qu'il ne réagissait même pas aux balles.<sb>On a dû procéder à un certain nombre de modifications sur les zombies<sb>réanimés pour faire comprendre aux joueurs que ce comportement était intentionnel.<sb>D'abord, on a modifié l'animation d'introduction<cr>du zombie réanimé pour<sb>inclure des effets de particules et des sons qui soulignent<sb>les changements liés à ce nouveau type de combat.<sb>Ensuite, on a remplacé les particules et les bruits d'impact pour que<sb>les tirs sur le zombie semblent moins efficaces que dans les affrontements<sb>précédents contre des zombies non réanimés.<sb>Enfin, on a modifié le zombie réanimé pour qu'il ne déclenche pas<sb>d'animation de tressaillement ou ne réagisse pas aux balles, ce qui<sb>permet d'indiquer aux joueurs que son comportement est différent.<sb>On s'est également servi du raviveur lui-même pour illustrer la nouvelle<sb>expérience de combat.<sb>Des effets électriques ont été ajoutés pour indiquer le mouvement<sb>du raviveur à l'intérieur du zombie, avec un bruit sec et un effet lumineux quand<sb>il émerge à un autre endroit du corps.<sb>Avec ces nouveaux visuels ainsi que des sons et des cris pertinents<sb>du raviveur quand il se faisait toucher, les testeurs comprenaient mieux<sb>et appréciaient davantage la nouvelle mécanique<cr>de combat.
Dans nos premiers concepts, un zombie réanimé était simplement un zombie<sb>invincible doté d'un point faible mobile.<sb>Les tests ont révélé qu'il était moins impressionnant et menaçant<sb>que le raviveur seul, et comme on voulait que<cr>le zombie réanimé soit<sb>un adversaire sérieux, on a dû améliorer ses capacités offensives.<sb>On a décidé de créer un champ électrique autour<cr>du zombie réanimé,<sb>comme une manifestation de la nature électrique<cr>du raviveur,<sb>afin que les joueurs qui s'approcheraient trop près subissent<sb>d'importants dégâts électriques.<sb>Ça a très bien marché dans de nombreux tests, jusqu'à ce qu'on observe<sb>un joueur qui était un véritable tireur d'élite<cr>dans la réalité.<sb>Ce joueur était capable de battre facilement<cr>le zombie réanimé sans même<sb>être mis en danger.<sb>En réponse, on a donné au zombie réanimé<cr>sa contre-attaque électrique<sb>au sol, qui force le joueur à changer de position pour éviter de subir des dégâts.<sb>Ça a créé un rythme d'attaques et de replis qui était plus intense<sb>et gratifiant pour le joueur.
Comme un jeu en VR doit toujours être rendu depuis une caméra virtuelle<sb>correspondant au point de vue du joueur, nos possibilités pour contrôler<sb>ce que voit le joueur sont limitées.<sb>Les ascenseurs sont un des rares outils qu'on utilise en VR pour diriger la vue du joueur.<sb>Un ascenseur qui monte, comme celui-ci, peut être utilisé de la même<sb>manière qu'un plan grue qu'on voit au cinéma, pour aller d'un point<sb>culminant à un autre afin de montrer une vue magnifique ou de révéler<sb>un élément de l'histoire.<sb>En VR, il est parfois difficile de rendre les ascenseurs confortables,<sb>car le déplacement d'un ascenseur virtuel n'est pas interprété par le système<sb>vestibulaire du joueur.<sb>On s'est rendu compte qu'on pouvait rendre<cr>les phases en ascenseur dans<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> assez confortables pour la plupart des joueurs en faisant<sb>en sorte que l'ascenseur se déplace lentement, et en limitant le champ de vision du joueur.<sb>Cet ascenseur était à l'origine beaucoup plus ouvert, mais on a<sb>progressivement occulté la vue pour que le champ de vision du joueur soit<sb>toujours principalement occupé par l'ascenseur<cr>lui-même.<sb>De cette manière, on a pu montrer l'extérieur<cr>de l'hôtel<sb>et la sous-station du Cartel comme on le voulait, et les joueurs ne ressentaient<sb>aucune gêne car ils avaient toujours l'ascenseur comme cadre de référence visuel.
Après avoir quitté l'ascenseur,<cr>le joueur peut voir de près<sb>la sous-station du Cartel, accolée à l'hôtel.<sb>Si l'architecture du Cartel peut parfois sembler abstraite, son esthétique<sb>s'avère particulièrement réussie quand elle est mise en contraste avec une construction humaine.<sb>En plus de ça, on essaie toujours de souligner<cr>le design visuel avec<sb>une nouvelle fonction, dans l'idéal au service<cr>du gameplay ou de l'histoire.<sb>Ici, l'acheminement vers la chambre forte<cr>d'une source d'énergie<sb>inhabituelle provenant de divers endroits de la ville.<sb>Le joueur ne le sait pas à ce moment précis, mais cette sous-station<sb>est conçue pour contraindre par la torture un groupe de Vortigaunts à chanter.<sb>Ils sont dans les nacelles attachées.<sb>L'énergie est récoltée avant d'être « réharmonisée » par un seul<sb>Vortigaunt « conducteur » via le dispositif câblé qu'on voit au départ<sb>des câbles de transmission directement reliés<cr>à la chambre forte.<sb>Ce design nous donne l'opportunité de rencontrer par la suite un autre<sb>Vortigaunt, et constitue une contrainte permettant de créer<sb>une interaction pouvant compromettre la sous-station quand le joueur quittera<sb>l'hôtel dans la carte suivante.
La végétation xenienne a été conçue pour réagir au joueur de plusieurs façons.<sb>Dans les zones sombres où la lampe torche est activée, une partie<sb>de la flore xenienne s'anime pour réagir à la lumière.<sb>Ces plantes xeniennes réagissent à proximité<cr>de la main du joueur en luisant et en palpitant.<sb>Cet effet de lumière spécifique est rendu<cr>par un offset utilisant<sb>la perspective curviligne adéquate pour chaque
il, ce qui donne l'impression<sb>que la lumière émane de l'intérieur de l'organisme.<sb>Les effets de shader de la flore xenienne qui se basent sur la proximité<sb>de la main prennent leur input d'un volume de voxels dynamique qui suit le joueur en permanence.<sb>Dans ce volume de voxels, les mains du joueur génèrent des traînées<sb>qui peuvent être reprises<cr>par les shaders de la végétation pour créer<sb>des déformations et d'autres effets d'ombrage.<sb>Si les mains sont déplacées rapidement, elles génèrent des traînées<sb>dans le volume de voxels.<sb>Si elles sont immobiles, elles produisent une force irradiante.<sb>Ces différents types de caractéristiques de mouvement nous permettent<sb>de créer différents comportements de la végétation pour lui donner une sorte de personnalité.
Les effets de particules constituent un défi intéressant en VR à cause<sb>de la stéréopsie, c'est-à-dire notre capacité à discerner la profondeur<sb>des objets à partir de deux points de vue légèrement différents du monde perçu<cr>par nos deux yeux.<sb>Les modèles de particules classiques, comme on le voit sur la gauche,<sb>ont été implémentés à la manière d'une série d'images de flipbook, affichées<sb>sur des polygones relativement gros qui s'orientent face au joueur.<sb>Chaque série d'images contiendrait effectivement un petit film<sb>d'un phénomène plus complexe comme une volute de fumée,<sb>une flamme vacillante, etc.<sb>Pour les rendus monoscopiques utilisés dans<cr>les systèmes non VR,<sb>cette approche fonctionne bien et s'utilise fréquemment dans le secteur.<sb>Mais en raison du rendu stéréo de la VR,<cr>les joueurs peuvent aisément voir<sb>les cartes plates, ce qui produit l'effet peu convaincant qu'on voit à gauche.<sb>Pour corriger ça, on a dû mettre à jour<cr>nos techniques de rendu<sb>de particules pour la VR.<sb>Le système de particules à droite est une version adaptée à la VR<sb>de l'ancien effet qu'on voit à gauche.<sb>Une des techniques qu'on a employées sur<cr>les grandes cartes comme celles<sb>de cet effet de fumée consiste à créer une résistance à la réaction<sb>des cartes au mouvement de la tête du joueur.<sb>Pour ce faire, on a créé un autre système de particules, décalé<sb>par rapport à la position du joueur, et utilisé comme la caméra du joueur<sb>pour orienter les cartes de fumée.<sb>En retirant la relation de face à face du mouvement de tête par rapport<sb>à la rotation du sprite, on a réussi à donner l'impression que la fumée est volumétrique.<sb>En plus d'utiliser davantage d'éléments 3D pour<cr>nos effets, on a aussi<sb>souvent utilisé un flou de post-traitement sur<cr>les particules pour<sb>faciliter le mélange des éléments graphiques qui, sinon, ressembleraient à<sb>un ensemble de surfaces planes.<sb>De cette manière, les cartes ont un aspect plus diffus et volumétrique,<sb>et se confondent plus difficilement en stéréoscopie.
Un des principes du game design de <I>Half-Life<I> résidait dans la volonté de<sb>créer à chaque instant des expériences fabriquées auxquelles le joueur<sb>participait tout en progressant dans le jeu.<sb>Parfois, ça impliquait de jouer avec les réactions émotionnelles afin de<sb>transformer quelque chose d'a priori peu agréable en un instant mémorable.<sb>Cette partie effondrée de l'hôtel incarne ce type d'expérience.<sb>Par instinct, les joueurs sont souvent attirés par<cr>les endroits d'aspect<sb>plus sûr, et ici, ce serait le couloir bien éclairé<cr>au-dessus.<sb>Mais quand ils y vont, ils se retrouvent bloqués par un champ de force du Cartel.<sb>Le câble d'alimentation permettant de couper<cr>le champ de force du Cartel<sb>les oblige à redescendre dans les ténèbres infestées<sb>de crabes de tête empoisonnés.<sb>Un endroit où ils ne voulaient vraiment pas aller.<sb>Ces espaces de gameplay plus vastes devaient également fonctionner malgré les choix du joueur.<sb>Donc, même si un joueur choisit de ne pas monter dans le couloir éclairé,<sb>il éprouvera probablement la même anxiété en descendant dans l'obscurité malgré tout.<sb>Après avoir bravé les ténèbres et s'être réfugié dans la pièce éclairée<sb>à l'abri des crabes de tête errants, le joueur doit couper le courant<sb>du champ de force du Cartel, une tâche intimidante car la zone se retrouve<sb>par conséquent plongée dans l'obscurité.<sb>Non seulement ça complique la situation, puisque<cr>le joueur doit remonter<sb>à la lumière de sa seule lampe torche, mais en plus, la sortie passe par<sb>la zone qui grouille de crabes de tête empoisonnés.<sb>On a passé beaucoup de temps à peaufiner cette expérience par les tests et les évaluations.<sb>Souvent, quand ils parlaient de leur exploration de l'hôtel dans<sb>les discussions d'après test, les joueurs évoquaient ce passage dans<sb>l'obscurité comme un moment marquant, qui réussissait à associer<sb>le plaisir du jeu à un sentiment d'angoisse global.
Le placement des ressources est un problème de game design récurrent,<sb>et ce moment du jeu en est un bon exemple.<sb>Le joueur vient juste de quitter la zone dans laquelle il a récupéré<sb>le pistolet mitrailleur du Cartel.<sb>À chaque fois qu'il acquiert une nouvelle arme,<cr>on lui donne tout de suite<sb>l'opportunité de l'essayer.<sb>Juste après l'obtention du pistolet mitrailleur, on a donc placé pas mal<sb>de munitions pour cette arme, et un groupe d'ennemis peu dangereux<sb>
des zombies enfermés et des crabes de tête errants
<sb>pour qu'il puisse s'exercer.<sb>Mais les tests nous ont montré que les joueurs pouvaient réagir<sb>à cette configuration de bien des manières.<sb>Certains abattent un crabe de tête ou deux et continuent, tandis que<sb>d'autres prennent le temps d'examiner leur arme, parfois même en utilisant<sb>toutes les munitions qu'on leur donne.<sb>Après les crabes de tête, le joueur se dirige vers une nouvelle zone<sb>où se trouve l'une des arènes de combat les plus difficiles du jeu,<sb>dans laquelle il doit affronter deux raviveurs en même temps.<sb>Quelle quantité de munitions le joueur aura-t-il ici ? Combien faut-il<sb>en mettre dans cette zone entre les deux arènes pour être sûr<sb>que tous les joueurs en auront assez pour abattre les deux raviveurs ?<sb>Si on n'en met pas suffisamment, un joueur pourrait se retrouver dans<sb>l'impossibilité de survivre au combat, sans qu'une reprise<sb>de sa sauvegarde puisse l'aider.<sb>Il devrait alors revenir en arrière et rejouer la zone précédente<sb>en conservant cette fois plus de munitions.<sb>C'est quelque chose que nous voulons éviter, mais ça ne risque pas<sb>non plus d'arriver à tous les joueurs.<sb>La plupart du temps, ils tenteront de battre les deux raviveurs<sb>et échoueront à plusieurs reprises.<sb>Fondamentalement, le problème posé par le placement des ressources est que<sb>la quantité de ressources possédées par les joueurs est très variable,<sb>et l'écart min/max augmente au fil du jeu.<sb>Dans <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, on voyait certains joueurs finir le jeu avec<sb>quasiment plus aucune munition, tandis que d'autres avaient<sb>plus de 1 000 munitions inutilisées.
Alors, comment gérer le placement des ressources quand il y a un tel écart<sb>dans les ressources acquises et utilisées ? Comme dans beaucoup de jeux,<sb>on a opté pour un système dynamique qui tient compte des ressources<sb>actuelles du joueur et prend des décisions en fonction.<sb>Mais la conception de tels systèmes peut s'avérer délicate car ils ont<sb>tendance à affecter le comportement du joueur.<sb>Dans <I>Half-Life 2<I>, par exemple, on a placé des caisses cassables dans<sb>le jeu qui généraient des ressources dynamiquement en fonction des niveaux<sb>de santé et de munitions actuels du joueur.<sb>L'avantage était que nous n'étions pas obligés de consacrer beaucoup<sb>de tests à l'équilibrage des ressources, parce que tant qu'il y avait assez<sb>de caisses, le joueur avait toujours assez de ressources.<sb>Mais en raison de la présence de ce système, on ne passait pas beaucoup<sb>de temps sur le placement des ressources, et par conséquent, on ne créait pas<sb>vraiment de défis autour de la collecte de ressources.<sb>Les joueurs comprenaient également qu'ils n'avaient pas à se soucier<sb>de leurs niveaux de ressources, car les caisses allaient toujours leur fournir<sb>ce dont ils avaient le plus besoin.<sb>Pour <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, on a voulu changer de perspective.<sb>On savait que la recherche de ressources dans un environnement VR était<sb>quelque chose que les joueurs aimaient beaucoup.<sb>C'est pourquoi on a souhaité que la collecte de ressources soit<sb>une activité obligatoire pour le joueur dans toute l'aventure.<sb>Plus précisément, on voulait qu'il n'en arrive jamais au point où il avait<sb>tellement de munitions et de santé qu'il n'était plus obligé d'explorer le monde.<sb>On a également pu lancer les tests plus tôt que dans <I>Half-Life 2<I><sb>dans le cycle de développement, ce qui nous a rassurés sur le fait que nous avions<sb>tout le temps nécessaire pour placer correctement chaque ressource.
Dans <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, on a opté pour un système permettant de créer une<sb>expérience plus spécifique au moyen d'une fonctionnalité dynamique<sb>qui tente de réduire les écarts de collecte de ressources entre les joueurs. <sb>Au lieu de placer des ressources génériques changeant de type,<sb>les concepteurs de niveaux ont soigneusement placé chaque type de ressource dans l'environnement.<sb>Certains sont faciles à trouver, d'autres plus difficiles.<sb>Ensuite, à mesure que le joueur progresse dans l'environnement, le système<sb>supprime de façon opportune des ressources en fonction des niveaux<sb>de ressources actuels du joueur.<sb>Cette stratégie présente l'avantage de donner aux concepteurs de niveaux<sb>un contrôle important sur les ressources du joueur dans les différentes zones du jeu.<sb>Ils ont ainsi pu créer des zones où ils voulaient que le joueur manque<sb>d'un type précis de munitions, ou l'encourager à en utiliser un autre.<sb>Par exemple, dans cette zone, les concepteurs ont pu placer assez<sb>de munitions pour s'assurer que le joueur puisse affronter<sb>les deux raviveurs, tout en sachant que le système en enlèverait une partie<sb>si le joueur en possédait assez.<sb>On pouvait donc placer une grande quantité de munitions pour le PM<sb>du Cartel dans la zone précédente parce qu'on savait que les joueurs<sb>qui passaient les crabes de tête empoisonnés sans tirer un coup de feu<sb>n'en trouveraient plus ici.<sb>Il y a un certain nombre d'autres fonctionnalités qui permettent<sb>de résoudre les incohérences causées par ce système. Par exemple,<sb>faire en sorte que les joueurs trouvent toujours quelque chose dans un casier<sb>du Cartel, ou qu'ils soient toujours récompensés pour<sb>leurs recherches régulières et minutieuses, même s'ils transportent beaucoup de munitions.<sb>Ce qu'on veut, c'est qu'au bout du compte, le joueur qui fait<sb>plus attention à l'environnement se retrouve avantagé en termes de ressources.<sb>Il nous fallait seulement des instruments de mesure pour contrôler cet avantage.
Jusqu'ici, chaque rencontre avec un raviveur avait pour but d'apprendre<sb>au joueur quelque chose de nouveau sur cette créature afin qu'il puisse la vaincre.<sb>Cette arène constitue le point culminant de cet apprentissage.<sb>Il n'y a pas de nouvelle règle.<sb>Il n'y a rien à apprendre sur le raviveur.<sb>À ce moment du jeu, le joueur possède les connaissances requises pour pouvoir progresser.<sb>Désormais, le défi est une épreuve de combat qui demande<sb>de la stratégie et de l'adresse.<sb>Le joueur doit hiérarchiser et abattre plusieurs cibles, utiliser toutes<sb>ses armes et gérer un approvisionnement restreint en munitions afin de<sb>s'imposer pour revenir à l'extérieur de l'hôtel et neutraliser la sous-station du Cartel.
Une des sous-intrigues principales de l'histoire traite de<sb>l'emprisonnement et de l'utilisation des Vortigaunts<sb>par le Cartel pour piéger le G-man.<sb>Le pouvoir multidimensionnel des Vortigaunts, qui permet de contenir un G-man<sb>apparemment invincible, est expliqué dans<cr>des épisodes précédents<sb>de <I>Half-Life<I>. Grâce aux cellules de prisonniers et à la technologie des sous-stations,<sb>le Cartel extrait le pouvoir du chant de vortessence des Vortigaunts,<sb>puis convertit cette énergie pour la transmettre<cr>à la chambre forte qui contient le G-man.<sb>Pour communiquer ça au joueur sans se lancer dans des explications<sb>fastidieuses, on a utilisé des motifs de sons harmonieux afin de<sb>représenter ce processus de façon implicite.<sb>Si vous vous placez près des cellules qui enferment les Vortigaunts,<sb>vous les entendez gémir leur chant sur un motif semi-musical lent.<sb><wait:9>Juste après les cellules se trouve le « résonateur », dans lequel on peut<sb>entendre une version distillée de l'énergie du chant.<sb><wait:16>Pour finir, les câbles sont activés par l'énergie vortigaunt<sb>concentrée, qui est harmonisée dans différentes variations et transmise<sb>par intermittence à la chambre forte lorsque l'énergie est suffisante.<sb>Si vous passez près des câbles pendant l'harmonisation, vous pourrez<sb>entendre toute l'ampleur et la profondeur du son.<sb>On a réalisé ça en plaçant les émetteurs audio de chaque câble directement<sb>là où se trouvent les câbles.<sb>Les bruits des câbles couvrent une vaste gamme de fréquences qui<sb>accentuent la « fonction de transfert relative<cr>à la tête » de Steam Audio.<sb>Cette simulation, associée au retour de l'oreille interne<sb>du spectateur qui regarde en l'air, donne une impression de grandeur<sb>similaire à celle que la VR est capable de donner aux objets visuels.<sb><wait:17>
Dans un jeu en VR, la performance<cr>des personnages<sb>présente un ensemble unique d'opportunités<cr>et de défis.<sb>Dans nos efforts pour donner un maximum<cr>de contrôle au joueur, on doit<sb>créer une performance assez intéressante pour conserver son attention,<sb>mais aussi assez flexible pour lui donner<cr>de la liberté.<sb>Cette scène est celle qui comporte le plus d'interactions en face à face<sb>dans le jeu, et il n'y a pas de barrière physique entre le joueur<sb>et le Vortigaunt quand ce dernier apparaît pour<cr>la première fois.<sb>À un moment, on a eu l'idée de faire sursauter<cr>le joueur lors de<sb>la libération du Vortigaunt, et de bousculer ainsi<cr>ses attentes par rapport<sb>à ce qui, jusqu'alors, était considéré comme<cr>une simple « batterie ».<sb>Non seulement cet effet était un peu maladroit, mais en plus,<sb>le Vortigaunt, qui sortait en s'agitant de la cellule, entrait souvent<sb>dans l'espace occupé par le joueur.<sb>Pour résoudre ce problème, on a retiré cet élément de surprise et on<sb>a fait reculer la cellule hors de l'espace du joueur au moment où<sb>elle s'ouvre, afin de permettre au Vortigaunt de sortir<sb>à une distance confortable.<sb>On a eu un problème similaire quand il a fallu faire en sorte que<sb>le joueur et le Vortigaunt se rendent à leur destination suivante sans se bloquer.<sb>On a d'abord voulu que le joueur et le Vortigaunt se retrouvent côte à côte<sb>face au panorama pendant que la créature explique la situation.<sb>Il aurait été maladroit pour le joueur et le Vortigaunt de prendre la même route<sb>sur la passerelle, alors on a envisagé d'autres options,<sb>en imaginant notamment comment le Vortigaunt pouvait se déplacer<sb>dans son environnement d'origine.<sb>Avec leurs longs avant-bras, il était possible qu'ils se déplacent comme<sb>des quadrupèdes, c'est pourquoi on a choisi<cr>une escalade agile<sb>à quatre membres, jusqu'à une plateforme où il pouvait parler sans gêne l'espace du joueur.
Lors du développement de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, il y avait beaucoup de gens<sb>issus de disciplines différentes qui travaillaient sur un nombre de cartes relativement restreint.<sb>Ça voulait dire qu'on avait souvent plusieurs personnes qui travaillaient<sb>sur la même carte en même temps.<sb>Pour gérer cette organisation complexe, on a divisé nos cartes<sb>en plus petits segments qu'on appelait des<cr>« préfabriqués », ou « préfabs ».<sb>Un préfab pouvait contenir les mêmes types de géométrie ou de logique,<sb>les mêmes ennemis, systèmes de particules ou autres éléments qu'une carte normale.<sb>Tant que les gens travaillaient sur des préfabs séparés, ils pouvaient<sb>modifier ou ajouter des choses sans gêner le travail des autres.<sb>Un préfab pouvait renfermer un espace physique important comme<sb>cette section de la rue, ou simplement contenir quelques éléments.<sb>Les grands préfabs qui segmentaient les cartes pour permettre le travail<sb>en collaboration étaient essentiels dans un projet de cette ampleur,<sb>mais beaucoup de préfabs plus petits et réutilisables ont aussi été créés<sb>pour <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Par exemple, on a utilisé les préfabs de véhicule qu'on peut voir ici et tout au long du jeu.<sb>Chaque véhicule a été créé comme un préfab configurable,<sb>que les concepteurs pouvaient placer rapidement dans le jeu en définissant<sb>simplement quelques paramètres pour adapter<cr>le véhicule au contexte.<sb>Les paramètres incluent des éléments comme<cr>la couleur du véhicule,<sb>la quantité de dégâts préexistants, le fait que<cr>la portière soit ouverte<sb>ou arrachée, et le type de munitions ou ressources<sb>que le véhicule peut contenir.<sb>Ça a accéléré notre flux de travail et voulait aussi dire que<sb>les mises à jour apportées à un préfab se propageaient automatiquement<sb>à toutes les cartes qui l'utilisaient.
Les bâches utilisées par le Cartel pour recouvrir<cr>les bâtiments dans<sb>la zone de quarantaine sont animées de façon procédurale.<sb>Cette animation a été ajoutée relativement tard dans le développement,<sb>c'est pourquoi il fallait qu'elle soit technologiquement basique et peu<sb>gourmande en ressources.<sb>Donc, pas de nouveau système.<sb>Quand les bâches s'agitent contre les bâtiments,<cr>on utilise simplement<sb>des effets d'ondes qui se chevauchent pour déplacer leur géométrie.<sb>Les mouvements s'orientent dans la direction du vent, et le sens de<sb>leur propagation est en plus modifié par<cr>les gradients d'une texture<sb>qu'on appelle « carte de liberté de déplacement ».<sb>Cette texture se base sur la géométrie du bâtiment sous la bâche et permet<sb>d'atténuer le déplacement pour que la bâche ne s'anime pas aux endroits<sb>où elle est censée être plaquée contre le bâtiment.<sb>De cette manière, on obtient une bâche qui s'agite en fonction du vent<sb>et de façon cohérente avec son environnement.
Le soldat du Cartel qu'on voit ici ne vous attaquera pas.<sb>Il a été programmé pour aller et venir sur<cr>le parcours indiqué au sol,<sb>afin d'illustrer le système de reciblage des foulées développé pour <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Une des difficultés liées à l'animation des personnages numériques est de<sb>faire en sorte que leurs pieds ne semblent pas glisser sur le sol quand ils se déplacent.<sb>Les humains sont très forts pour détecter<cr>les défauts dans<sb>les déplacements des personnages virtuels, surtout en VR, et les soldats<sb>du Cartel doivent donner l'impression d'être ancrés dans le sol et de<sb>se déplacer lourdement, sinon ils sembleraient ne pas avoir de poids, ce qui<sb>les rendrait peu crédibles.<sb>Dans une phase de prétraitement, notre système de reciblage des foulées<sb>analyse les phases de chaque animation créée et les stocke en tant que<sb>trajectoire indépendamment de la direction.<sb>Au moment de l'exécution, notre système prédit où chaque pied se posera<sb>lors de la foulée suivante en fonction du mouvement de l'animation,<sb>du parcours du personnage et de l'élévation du sol.<sb>Les paires de boîtes de couleur au sol illustrent<cr>ce processus.<sb>Les boîtes rouges indiquent les positions précédentes des pieds.<sb>Les boîtes vertes indiquent les positions actuelles des pieds<sb>et les bleues apparaissent là où chaque pied devra se poser ensuite.<sb>Une fois que les positions de pieds ciblées sont calculées, le système<sb>guide les pieds jusqu'aux positions visées en utilisant les informations<sb>de trajectoire pour préserver le style de l'animation originale.<sb>Une fois le pied posé, il est verrouillé à sa position jusqu'à la prochaine phase.<sb>Finalement, ce système était si efficace qu'on pouvait faire des animations<sb>de course dans quasiment n'importe quelle direction sans aucun glissement de pieds.<sb>Vous pouvez tester ce système en vous déplaçant dans la zone, car ce soldat<sb>a été conçu pour vous faire toujours face en courant sur le même parcours.
Les mines sont apparues dans des <I>Half-Life<I> précédents, et l'action<sb>de déminage semblait bien se prêter à un jeu en VR qui permet de faire<sb>des opérations complexes avec les mains.<sb>À ce stade du jeu, le joueur a déjà appris à pirater les technologies<sb>du Cartel avec son outil multifonction, mais on voulait que le déminage<sb>d'une mine génère plus de tension que les casse-tête de piratage.<sb>Pour désamorcer une mine, non seulement<cr>le joueur devait placer sa main<sb>près du laser qui pouvait déclencher la mine,<cr>mais il devait faire<sb>cette action en quelques secondes à peine.<sb>Les premières versions de ce casse-tête s'inspiraient du crochetage,<sb>et le joueur devait aligner rapidement une série<cr>de goupilles.<sb>Malheureusement, le design des goupilles nécessitait que le joueur tourne<sb>les poignets de façon inconfortable, d'autant plus qu'en réalisant<sb>ce mouvement, il devait aussi éviter de toucher<cr>le laser.<sb>On a donc retiré l'élément rotatif,<cr>mais on a gardé la contrainte<sb>de temps, ce qui aboutit à la mécanique qu'on voit dans le jeu.<sb>On a également fait des essais en provoquant l'explosion des mines<sb>si le joueur ne parvenait pas à les désamorcer, mais la plupart des joueurs<sb>trouvaient ça trop punitif, surtout dans les cas où une réaction<sb>en chaîne pouvait se produire.<sb>Alors, on a simplement laissé les mines activées et le joueur peut réessayer de les désamorcer.<sb>On a quand même gardé ce comportement dans<cr>le mode difficile, mais en<sb>ajoutant un signal sonore avant l'explosion pour laisser au joueur un peu<sb>de temps pour se mettre à l'abri.<sb>On a aussi essayé d'introduire la possibilité de prendre les mines<sb>désamorcées pour les redéployer par la suite, mais on n'avait pas créé<sb>assez de scénarios de combat autour de cette mécanique pour<sb>qu'elle s'avère satisfaisante, alors on l'a simplement supprimée.
Cette arène de combat qui se répète quand<cr>le joueur traverse les immeubles<sb>résidentiels fait partie des premières cartes de test qui ont été créées<sb>quand on a commencé à ajouter des soldats du Cartel dans <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Une des leçons qu'on a tirées de cette série de combats était que<sb>les affrontements contre les soldats<cr>du Cartel étaient si éprouvants<sb>physiquement pour les joueurs qu'il fallait faire attention au rythme.<sb>Se mettre à couvert, recharger, changer d'arme et viser les ennemis<sb>sollicitaient toutes les compétences que les joueurs avaient apprises jusqu'à ce stade.<sb>Pour atténuer la fatigue, on a inséré des pauses entre les rencontres avec<sb>le Cartel, et supprimé une partie des combats afin de mieux rythmer l'expérience.<sb>Les mines dans l'escalier après ce combat sont un bon exemple des éléments<sb>de rythme qu'on utilise pour ralentir le joueur et lui permettre<sb>de récupérer avant que l'action ne regagne<cr>en intensité.
Utiliser l'histoire pour créer l'environnement qui aurait pu se développer<sb>dans la zone de quarantaine était un défi passionnant pour les graphistes<sb>et les concepteurs de niveaux.<sb>Tout comme l'hôtel, ces appartements ont été envahis par la végétation<sb>xenienne et sont remplis d'effets personnels abandonnés par les habitants<sb>dans la précipitation.<sb>Dans cette zone, les murs ont été abattus, soit par de violents ouragans<sb>de portail, soit peut-être par des opérations de nettoyage du Cartel.<sb>Il y a là des barils de produits utilisés par<cr>des employés pour tenter<sb>de traiter ou de contenir la prolifération xenienne,<cr>et apparemment,<sb>tous les efforts de nettoyage ont été abandonnés ou infructueux.<sb>En n'expliquant pas tous les aspects du monde,<cr>on laisse aux joueurs<sb>la possibilité d'imaginer eux-mêmes les conditions de vie plus globales dans Cité 17.
Une fois l'ossature du jeu terminée, les équipes sont revenues sur<sb>les cartes pour chercher des opportunités supplémentaires d'injecter l'esprit<sb>et le ton que les joueurs associaient<cr>aux jeux <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Ce crabe de tête mannequin était une occasion amusante de jouer<sb>sur l'esprit SF/horreur/série B.<sb>On a pas mal discuté pour savoir combien de temps il fallait laisser<sb>le crabe sur la tête du mannequin, et on a décidé que l'expérience serait<sb>comparable au fait de surprendre un petit chien en train de faire une bêtise.<sb>On voulait que le joueur ait l'impression d'avoir vu quelque chose<sb>qu'il n'était pas censé voir, et qu'il s'en aille en se disant qu'il y avait<sb>des choses à découvrir dans chaque recoin du jeu s'il choisissait<sb>de l'explorer à fond.<sb>Après une mise à jour des sons du crabe de tête, qui ajoutait pour<sb>la première fois des détails comme la respiration et les grognements, on a eu<sb>des retours indiquant que les nouveaux sons étaient trop mignons<sb>et familiers. Ça voulait dire que la créature ressemblait trop à un animal<sb>tout doux et pas assez à une menace extraterrestre.<sb>On a donc modifié les sons pour les rendre plus menaçants, mais pour<sb>ce crabe de tête précis, on a repris certains des bruits sympas pour montrer<sb>la frustration de la créature par rapport<cr>au mannequin.
Pour limiter les rechargements nécessaires<cr>dans le feu de l'action,<sb>on a voulu que les joueurs puissent améliorer<cr>le pistolet<sb>en augmentant sa capacité de munitions.<sb>Cette modification peut paraître mineure, mais réussir à l'implémenter<sb>d'une façon intuitive et avec peu d'inconvénients pour le joueur<sb>s'est avéré étonnamment complexe à réaliser.<sb>Notre première mécanique pour augmenter<cr>la capacité de munitions<sb>du pistolet consistait à utiliser des chargeurs double taille.<sb>Une fois l'arme améliorée, les chargeurs dans<cr>le sac à dos du joueur<sb>contenaient le double de balles et étaient représentés dans le jeu<sb>par un modèle deux fois plus long.<sb>Malheureusement, ces chargeurs rallongés présentaient de nombreux problèmes.<sb>Pour commencer, ils dépassaient de façon ridicule sous l'arme.<sb>Ensuite, les joueurs se demandaient ce qui se passait dans leur sac à dos<sb>quand les chargeurs simples qu'ils y mettaient se transformaient<sb>en chargeurs double capacité au moment où ils les sortaient.<sb>On avait aussi l'impression assez absurde que<cr>les chargeurs trouvés dans<sb>l'environnement s'étaient comme par magie transformés en versions doubles.<sb>On a supprimé les chargeurs XXL, mais le concept était toujours séduisant.<sb>Il fallait simplement trouver une meilleure métaphore.<sb>C'est là qu'on a pensé aux réservoirs des marqueurs de paintball,<sb>qui stockent un grand nombre de billes de peinture.<sb>En fait, l'amélioration finale issue de cette réflexion est toujours<sb>appelée en interne « réservoir de balles ».<sb>En gardant cela à l'esprit, il fallait ensuite concevoir<sb>un modèle d'interaction intuitif.<sb>Les joueurs étaient satisfaits de la boucle d'interaction existante, qui était :<sb>retrait du chargeur, insertion de l'autre chargeur, armement et tir.<sb>On a donc voulu conserver ces gestes que<cr>les joueurs commençaient déjà à maîtriser.<sb>Les joueurs devaient alors recharger l'arme comme avant, mais un mécanisme<sb>récupérait les balles du chargeur inséré<cr>pour les stocker<sb>dans le réservoir et ensuite charger le magasin.<sb>Des effets audio ont été ajoutés pour indiquer l'état<sb>du processus de rechargement.<sb>Le réservoir nous a aussi permis de modifier<cr>le design pour montrer<sb>l'état de chargement du pistolet.<sb>À l'origine, les chargeurs comportaient un indicateur numérique affichant le nombre<sb>de balles restantes, et cet élément seul fonctionnait bien.<sb>Les joueurs le comprenaient facilement.<sb>Mais l'affichage du réservoir se trouvait de l'autre côté du pistolet, et il disposait<sb>d'un système de points bleus indiquant la quantité de balles restante.<sb>Avec ces deux dispositifs à deux endroits différents, les joueurs avaient du mal<sb>à déterminer rapidement le nombre total de balles dans le pistolet amélioré.<sb>Pour résoudre ce problème, on a utilisé un indicateur visuel global<sb>sur la crosse de l'arme.<sb>Il montre de façon cohérente l'état de remplissage du chargeur,<sb>de la chambre, et du réservoir de balles quand l'amélioration est acquise.
Pour <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, on voulait développer notre système d'environnement<sb>sonore, qui permet d'insérer des sons d'ambiance.<sb>Dans nos jeux précédents, on ne pouvait en général exécuter<sb>qu'une ambiance sonore à la fois.<sb>Le joueur entendait soit l'ambiance A, soit l'ambiance B avec un bref<sb>fondu enchaîné entre les deux.<sb>Dans ce jeu, les environnements sonores sont plus flexibles et peuvent<sb>se chevaucher de manière à créer des transitions plus réalistes.<sb>Par exemple, le volume des différentes ambiances peut être contrôlé par<sb>la position du joueur et par l'état ouvert/fermé de certaines portes de l'environnement.<sb>On utilise fréquemment cette fonctionnalité dans des zones comme<sb>cette transition entre des espaces intérieurs et extérieurs.<sb>Si vous faites une petite pause à l'extérieur, vous entendrez<sb>des grillons, des oiseaux, des chiens qui aboient au loin, ainsi que d'autres<sb>sons environnementaux qui contribuent à dépeindre la zone de quarantaine en fin de journée.<sb>Quand vous entrez dans une zone en intérieur, vous entendez les bruits<sb>de l'extérieur diminuer à mesure que vous vous éloignez de la porte.<sb>Et si vous fermez la porte, le volume des bruits de l'extérieur s'atténue davantage.<sb>Lorsque vous progressez dans le bâtiment, vous commencez à percevoir<sb>les ambiances d'intérieur, qui se composent du léger bourdonnement<sb>d'une machinerie indistincte et des grésillements d'appareils électriques.
En général, on fait en sorte de dédier une section du jeu<sb>à l'introduction des nouveaux types d'ennemis.<sb>Cela dit, il est assez rare qu'on intègre<cr>les introductions tôt dans<sb>le développement, car c'est souvent par les tests qu'on sait exactement<sb>quels aspects du nouvel ennemi doivent être mis en avant dans ces séquences.<sb>En plus de permettre au joueur de comprendre les capacités d'un nouvel<sb>ennemi, on s'est rendu compte que les introductions consolidaient<sb>l'existence même du nouveau type d'ennemi dans l'esprit du joueur.<sb>Sans introduction explicite, on voyait parfois<cr>les testeurs confondre<sb>plusieurs types d'ennemis.<sb>C'était le cas avec le suppresseur, la classe de soldat conçue pour<sb>bloquer le joueur à couvert pendant que les autres soldats avancent sur lui.<sb>Le suppresseur est une inversion des classes de soldats précédentes,<sb>qui avaient toutes pour but de déloger les joueurs de leurs positions.<sb>L'introduction du suppresseur s'étend sur les deux prochaines salles.<sb>Dans la première, le joueur voit le suppresseur tirer sur des zombies,<sb>ce qui lui donne un instant pour observer en toute sécurité<sb>son comportement d'attaque.<sb>Il peut aussi entendre les sons qui lui sont associés, ce qui est<sb>important pour les rencontres à venir.<sb>Dans la seconde salle, le joueur apprend à affronter le suppresseur lui-même.<sb>C'est un combat assez simple quand le suppresseur est seul, mais ça<sb>devient plus compliqué dans les arènes suivantes, quand le suppresseur<sb>est associé à d'autres types de soldats.
Comme il est difficile de répartir le temps de développement<sb>ou les ressources artistiques de façon égale dans toutes les parties du jeu,<sb>on fait appel à la réutilisation stratégique des ressources pour assurer<sb>la cohérence et les spécificités dans<cr>les environnements d'un jeu.<sb>Cet espace était à l'origine conçu à l'aide de modèles industriels<sb>et de textures qu'on voyait dans de nombreux environnements précédents.<sb>Pour lui donner une spécificité, on a ajouté<cr>les grands câbles<sb>et les cellules de Vortigaunts pour donner l'impression d'une centrale improvisée<sb>par le Cartel afin de transmettre de l'énergie aux sous-stations.<sb>La juxtaposition de cet espace industriel abandonné et des gros câbles<sb>du Cartel créait suffisamment d'intérêt visuel pour que l'endroit semble<sb>assez spécifique à moindre coût.<sb>L'élément récurrent du câble a ensuite été ajouté dans d'autres parties<sb>du jeu pour accentuer l'intérêt visuel, et donner<cr>au joueur la sensation<sb>d'être guidé vers la chambre forte.<sb>Ce n'est pas forcément visible, mais les câbles qui sortent par le plafond ici<sb>continuent à l'extérieur du bâtiment, traversent<cr>la grande cour et montent<sb>sur le toit de la distillerie, probablement pour rejoindre<sb>une sous-station ou une autre infrastructure<cr>du Cartel.<sb>Les joueurs ne remarquent peut-être pas cette continuation, mais ce genre<sb>de détails nous aide en nous guidant dans<cr>la construction d'un monde<sb>qui semble connecté et cohérent.
Un des problèmes posés par les types de déplacements d'<I>Alyx<I> en VR était<sb>de maintenir une expérience de combat identique, que les joueurs utilisent<sb>le déplacement continu ou la téléportation.<sb>Si les combats avaient été sensiblement différents selon les paramètres<sb>de déplacements, le nombre de combinaisons de test nécessaires<sb>aurait été énorme.<sb>Un moyen d'empêcher cette explosion combinatoire était de s'assurer que<sb>les IA puissent sentir les déplacements du joueur, quel que soit le type<sb>de déplacement choisi.<sb>Pour ce faire, on a créé un proxy visuel pour<cr>les joueurs utilisant<sb>le déplacement par téléportation.<sb>Imaginez un scénario dans lequel le joueur est à couvert, hors du champ<sb>de vision d'un soldat.<sb>Si le joueur utilise le déplacement continu pour courir jusqu'à un autre<sb>abri proche, le soldat le voit au moment où il est exposé.<sb>Mais le joueur qui se déplace instantanément d'un abri à l'autre<sb>ne peut pas être vu.<sb>Pour résoudre cette inégalité, quand un joueur utilise la téléportation,<sb>on laisse une trace de proxies visuels invisibles que seule l'IA ennemie peut voir.<sb>Ces proxies donnent l'information à l'IA telle qu'elle l'aurait reçue<sb>en voyant le joueur réaliser directement<cr>le déplacement.<sb>Dans ce cas, le soldat saurait que le joueur qui se téléporte a quitté<sb>sa position abritée pour courir vers un nouvel abri en s'exposant,<sb>comme un joueur utilisant le déplacement continu.<sb>Bien que ces types de fonctionnalités soient évidemment différents,<sb>car dans un cas le soldat n'a pas l'occasion de tirer sur le joueur<sb>qui se téléporte, ils nous ont permis de réduire<cr>le nombre de façons dont<sb>notre IA devait considérer les déplacements<cr>du joueur.
Pour les modes de déplacement par téléportation ou en continu, on crée<sb>différentes méthodes d'utilisation d'échelle.<sb>Par défaut, les joueurs qui utilisent la téléportation peuvent cibler<sb>une échelle et, après un court délai, être téléportés en haut ou en bas,<sb>suivant l'endroit d'où ils ont lancé l'action.<sb>Le délai était nécessaire pour s'assurer que<cr>les joueurs utilisent bien<sb>l'échelle intentionnellement.<sb>On voulait éviter qu'ils ne ciblent par erreur<cr>une échelle<sb>et se retrouvent désorientés en arrivant tout à coup en haut ou en bas.<sb>Les joueurs utilisant le déplacement continu peuvent attraper directement<sb>l'échelle pour monter ou descendre.<sb>Dans ce mode, ils peuvent saisir un barreau et déplacer la main vers<sb>le bas pour faire monter leur corps, ou déplacer<cr>la main vers le haut<sb>pour faire descendre leur corps.<sb>Ça leur permet de monter ou descendre une échelle<sb>barreau après barreau, de façon naturelle.<sb>Ce mode s'est avéré si populaire qu'on l'a ajouté en option, même pour<sb>les joueurs qui utilisaient le déplacement par téléportation.<sb>Dans notre jeu, la plupart des échelles ne dépassent pas de beaucoup<sb>le rebord du palier à atteindre.<sb>Ça complique la sortie du haut des échelles pour les joueurs utilisant<sb>le déplacement continu, car il y a rarement<cr>des barreaux à saisir au-dessus du palier.<sb>Pour résoudre ce problème, on détecte le moment où le joueur arrête<sb>de tenir l'échelle des deux mains et on le téléporte automatiquement soit<sb>en haut, soit en bas suivant la direction dans laquelle il va.<sb>Malheureusement, on n'a pas intégré beaucoup d'entraînements explicites<sb>à l'utilisation des échelles dans le jeu, ce qui fait que certains joueurs<sb>sont surpris par ce comportement de téléportation quand ils lâchent<sb>accidentellement les deux mains en grimpant.<sb>Malgré tout, c'était une meilleure solution que de laisser le joueur<sb>bloqué ou de le faire tomber s'il lâchait les mains. Certaines de<sb>nos échelles sont assez longues et il serait pénible de devoir regrimper<sb>parce que le joueur a relâché son attention juste avant d'arriver en haut.
Dans certaines de nos premières expériences sur le projet, on plaçait<sb>d'anciens modèles de <I>Half-Life 2<I> dans un niveau et on se promenait<sb>dans l'environnement en VR.<sb>On testait notamment des modèles statiques d'ennemis comme les soldats<sb>du Cartel ou les zombies.<sb>On a vu que les joueurs adoraient examiner ces modèles, parce que la VR<sb>leur permettait de s'approcher beaucoup plus près que par le passé.<sb>Les joueurs disaient qu'ils avaient une réelle sensation de la taille<sb>des personnages et remarquaient souvent des détails qu'ils n'avaient<sb>jamais vus, bien qu'ils aient déjà rencontré les modèles de nombreuses fois<sb>dans <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Ces réactions nous ont donné l'idée de créer un ennemi qui tirait parti<sb>de cette expérience. Un ennemi qui demandait au joueur de passer beaucoup<sb>de temps proche de lui physiquement.<sb>Mais en général, les ennemis ne laissent pas le joueur les approcher<sb>sans attaquer. Alors, on s'est dit que ça aurait du sens que cet ennemi<sb>soit aveugle et qu'il s'appuie sur autre chose qu'un gameplay de combat.<sb>Nos premières expériences pour guider une créature aveugle au moyen<sb>de sons se sont tout de suite révélées intéressantes, et nous ont donné<sb>un moyen de créer des scénarios uniques pour<cr>le jeu.<sb>C'est ainsi que le concept de Jeff, aussi appelé « le zombie aveugle » en interne, est né.
La plante qu'on voit ici sur le mur, baptisée « oreilles xeniennes »<sb>pour des raisons évidentes, s'anime en réaction aux mêmes sons que Jeff.<sb>Tôt dans le développement, on observait des situations dans lesquelles<sb>les testeurs ne remarquaient pas que Jeff réagissait mal à un bruit.<sb>Si le joueur mourait dans ces circonstances, il se sentait frustré<sb>et trouvait ça injuste.<sb>On a travaillé pour que les animations et les bruits de Jeff indiquent<sb>son niveau d'agressivité aussi clairement que possible, mais si les joueurs<sb>ne le regardaient pas, ils pouvaient se faire surprendre.<sb>L'ajout de ces oreilles xeniennes dans l'environnement était un moyen<sb>pour nous d'aider les joueurs à mieux percevoir les réactions de Jeff aux sons.<sb>Les oreilles xeniennes fonctionnent comme un feedback visuel<sb>supplémentaire du comportement de Jeff. Un feedback qui se trouve<sb>dans l'environnement, et non sur Jeff.
Dès le début du développement, on a voulu intégrer une grande diversité<sb>dans la flore et la faune xenienne pour <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Mais on ne savait pas encore comment utiliser ces éléments visuels<sb>pour créer un gameplay intéressant.<sb>Surnommées « mollusques xeniens » en interne, les plantes que vous voyez<sb>ici étaient à l'origine conçues pour agrémenter<cr>le visuel<sb>de l'environnement et n'étaient que légèrement interactives.<sb>Elles pouvaient suivre la tête et les mains du joueur et se refermaient<sb>si le joueur s'approchait trop près.<sb>Quand on a commencé à travailler sur Jeff, on voulait trouver des manières<sb>surprenantes d'utiliser le son comme mécanique de gameplay centrale.<sb>Plus spécifiquement, on voulait que les joueurs se méfient de leur environnement.<sb>On s'est rendu compte que les mollusques xeniens pouvaient devenir<sb>dangereux si on les faisait claquer en s'ouvrant et en se fermant<sb>rapidement quand le joueur s'en approchait.<sb>On avait déjà placé des mollusques plus tôt dans le jeu, ce qui voulait<sb>dire que le joueur atteignait la distillerie en sachant déjà<sb>comment ils fonctionnaient.<sb>L'introduction de Jeff a changé la relation du joueur avec les mollusques<sb>xeniens, car tout à coup, ces derniers ne sont plus seulement des éléments<sb>potentiellement agaçants mais inoffensifs. Ils deviennent dangereux et il faut les éviter.
Les premières versions de la distillerie intégraient diverses méthodes<sb>pour expliquer de façon subtile au joueur le fonctionnement de Jeff<sb>sans aucun discours explicite.<sb>Si certaines de ces techniques explicatives fonctionnaient bien,<sb>il fallait que le joueur comprenne parfaitement le comportement de Jeff.<sb>Sinon, il enchaînait les décès dans cette section du jeu et passait<sb>un très mauvais moment.<sb>On a fini par décider qu'une explication orale bien claire<sb>était nécessaire, et c'est là qu'on a introduit le personnage de Larry.<sb>Larry fonctionne comme un checkpoint qui fournit des informations capitales<sb>sur le comportement de Jeff avant de permettre au joueur de continuer.<sb>Il a fallu créer un environnement d'apprentissage dense mais avec un dosage<sb>subtil pour réussir à faire passer les règles de Jeff tout en faisant<sb>en sorte que Larry reste un personnage intéressant.<sb>Pour alléger le didacticiel, on a dû le répartir sur plusieurs éléments<sb>narratifs : Larry présente d'abord Jeff, ensuite il lui montre<sb>ses réactions prévisibles en cassant une bouteille, et pour finir, il dit<sb>au joueur de se couvrir la bouche pour ne pas tousser en respirant les spores xeniens.
Les plantes xeniennes qu'on voit ici émettent un gaz toxique qui provoque<sb>une toux. C'est un élément clé de l'environnement, et de Jeff lui-même.<sb>Elles n'ont pas été créées dans un simple but décoratif, ou pour exploiter<sb>l'interaction VR qui consiste à se couvrir la bouche.<sb>Elles ont été ajoutées spécifiquement pour relever un vieux défi<sb>qui consistait à illustrer l'espace personnel de Jeff.<sb>Une des plus grandes difficultés dans le design de Jeff était<sb>de trouver le bon équilibre entre menace perçue et menace réelle.<sb>De nombreux passages dans le niveau forcent le joueur à s'approcher<sb>tout près de Jeff pour créer de la tension.<sb>On s'est aperçu que ces moments pouvaient être excitants, mais qu'ils<sb>pouvaient aussi devenir frustrants quand le joueur s'approchait trop près<sb>de Jeff et se faisait tuer soudainement.<sb>Des joueurs nous ont indiqué ne pas bien comprendre quelle était<sb>la bonne distance. On a essayé un certain nombre de solutions, comme l'ajout<sb>de tentacules à Jeff pour indiquer visuellement quel était<sb>son espace personnel.<sb>Si vous touchiez les tentacules, vous mouriez.<sb>Toutefois, parvenir à un résultat satisfaisant en ce qui concernait<sb>l'aspect et les sensations de ces tentacules s'est avéré compliqué,<sb>et l'idée a été abandonnée.<sb>Un autre problème rencontré était qu'un certain nombre de nos joueurs<sb>se sont rapidement sentis à l'aise autour de Jeff dès qu'ils savaient garder<sb>leurs distances et éviter de faire du bruit.<sb>Pour ces joueurs, affronter Jeff était une formalité.<sb>Ils ne le ressentaient pas du tout comme une menace.<sb>On a évoqué diverses solutions pour résoudre ce problème, dont<sb>des méthodes farfelues qui consistaient par exemple à permettre à Jeff<sb>de se téléporter près des sources de bruit, mais c'était difficile de trouver<sb>des idées qui ne donnaient pas l'impression que Jeff triche.<sb>Finalement, on a eu l'idée de faire <I>tousser<I> le joueur.<sb>Ça collait bien, parce que ça nous donnait l'opportunité de faire<sb>du joueur lui-même une source de bruit qui lançait Jeff à sa poursuite.<sb>Ce qui nous intéressait aussi, c'était de rendre l'environnement<sb>globalement plus dangereux, et dans nos premières expériences, on a rempli<sb>le niveau de plantes xeniennes qui généraient du gaz toxique.<sb>Dès le départ, les tests étaient prometteurs.<sb>Les joueurs considéraient Jeff comme un prédateur dangereux<sb>et ils devaient faire attention à l'environnement pour éviter le gaz.<sb>On a vu que les joueurs avaient le réflexe<sb>de se couvrir la bouche pour se retenir de tousser.<sb>C'était un mouvement naturel qui fonctionnait bien en VR<sb>avec les contrôleurs à détection de mains,<sb>alors on a appliqué tout de suite cette mécanique.<sb>Il restait encore à régler le problème des joueurs qui n'arrivaient pas<sb>à prendre leurs distances avec Jeff.<sb>On s'est dit que l'idée d'ajouter des tentacules à Jeff pouvait facilement<sb>être remplacée par une approche beaucoup plus simple consistant à le lier<sb>directement à un nuage toxique.<sb>Cette solution présentait plusieurs avantages.<sb>D'abord, elle donnait au joueur une indication visuelle de la distance<sb>à respecter pour rester en sécurité.<sb>Ensuite, elle rendait encore plus intenses les moments où Jeff<sb>s'approchait très près, car les joueurs devaient utiliser une main<sb>pour se couvrir la bouche.<sb>Enfin, on n'avait plus rien de nouveau à expliquer au joueur.<sb>Il pouvait mettre en pratique avec Jeff les leçons qu'il avait apprises<sb>sur les gaz toxiques dans l'environnement.
Un de nos objectifs principaux dans le design de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> était de<sb>toucher le public le plus large possible.<sb>Ça signifiait qu'il fallait faire le jeu pour tous les principaux<sb>casques VR du marché, et s'adapter à des espaces de jeu de tailles<sb>variables et à différentes préférences de déplacement, entre autres.<sb>L'option d'accessibilité qui présentait le plus de répercussions sur le design<sb>du jeu, de la configuration des contrôleurs à la logique du jeu et au level design,<sb> était la prise en charge du mode un seul contrôleur pour les joueurs<sb>qui n'utilisent pas deux contrôleurs.<sb>Dans ce mode, le rechargement s'effectue en déplaçant l'arme vers l'épaule<sb>et en appuyant sur un bouton, un peu comme dans les jeux d'arcade<sb>qui demandent au joueur de tirer hors écran pour recharger.<sb>La lampe torche a été modifiée pour se fixer sur la main principale<sb>et des masques à gaz ont été ajoutés pour que les joueurs puissent contenir<sb>leur toux sans les mains.<sb>Même le pistolet utilisé dans le combat final contre le strider,<sb>dont les contrôles nécessitent une visée et un rechargement à deux mains,<sb>a été modifié pour être utilisé à une main.
Pendant qu'on affinait le comportement et l'aspect visuel de Jeff,<sb>on gardait constamment à l'esprit le ressenti du joueur.<sb>L'objectif était de faire en sorte que les testeurs décrivent Jeff avec<sb>des mots comme « dangereux », « menaçant » et<cr>« mortel ». C'est pour<sb>cette raison qu'il était important que le joueur ne survive pas<sb>s'il s'approchait trop près de Jeff. On a donc décidé que son attaque serait fatale.<sb>Ça devait apprendre au joueur que Jeff était trop dangereux pour être pris<sb>à la légère, mais ça nous mettait aussi au défi de lui expliquer tout ça<sb>sans forcément le tuer.<sb>L'approche choisie consistait à donner au joueur l'opportunité de voir Jeff<sb>attaquer et tuer <I>d'autres<I> personnages.<sb>Les premières versions du niveau incluaient des scénarios dans lesquels<sb>Jeff et le joueur rencontraient des zombies et des soldats du Cartel.<sb>Le joueur pouvait attaquer ces ennemis, ou faire du bruit afin d'attirer<sb>Jeff sur eux pour qu'il les massacre de ses bras énormes.<sb>Ça donnait aux joueurs l'opportunité de voir la puissance et le mode<sb>d'attaque de Jeff sans mourir sous ses coups.<sb>Malheureusement, cette issue n'était pas garantie car certains joueurs<sb>choisissaient de tuer ces ennemis eux-mêmes.<sb>Et le fait d'utiliser ces autres personnages s'avérait également coûteux<sb>en termes d'animation, de son et de contenu dans le niveau.<sb>On avait déjà des difficultés à donner un bon rythme à ce niveau tout en<sb>respectant nos contraintes, alors on a retiré ces sections.<sb>Mais on avait toujours notre problème initial, qui était de montrer<sb>la dangerosité de Jeff tout en évitant de tuer<cr>le joueur.<sb>On a choisi de le résoudre en insérant des pauses dans les séquences animées existantes.<sb>Par exemple, quand le joueur ouvre cette porte roulante à deux mains,<sb>on a ajouté un crabe de tête pour que Jeff le dévore sous les yeux du joueur.<sb>On a aussi intégré une pause similaire dans le passage de l'ascenseur,<sb>plus tard, quand Jeff écrase un crabe contre le mur avant de le dissoudre à l'acide.
Même si Larry explique au joueur les bases du fonctionnement de Jeff,<sb>on s'est rendu compte qu'il fallait laisser le joueur tester ces règles<sb>sans que Jeff soit dans leur espace personnel immédiat.<sb>Si on commençait par laisser les joueurs interagir avec Jeff en face<sb>à face, ils perdaient souvent leurs moyens et oubliaient les règles.<sb>Ils mouraient de façon répétée, et leur peur de Jeff se transformait<sb>rapidement en frustration et en agacement.<sb>Cette zone a été créée pour servir de terrain d'entraînement d'où<sb>le joueur peut, tout en restant à l'abri des attaques de Jeff, observer<sb>ses réactions à divers sons.<sb>Elle contient de nombreux éléments rencontrés dans le reste du niveau,<sb>dont les bouteilles qui tombent, un cadenas à détruire et les différents<sb>types de plantes xeniennes.<sb>Jeff est assez proche pour rester menaçant, mais il ne peut pas attaquer le joueur.<sb>Le joueur peut passer autant de temps qu'il le souhaite ici, et continuer<sb>quand il sent qu'il a bien compris le fonctionnement de Jeff.
Le design du personnage de Jeff a fait l'objet de plusieurs modifications<sb>majeures tout au long du développement.<sb>On voulait que le joueur comprenne certaines choses sur lui<sb>rien qu'en le regardant.<sb>Notre priorité absolue était d'indiquer sa cécité.<sb>Ensuite, il fallait que le personnage soit physiquement imposant.<sb>Après tout, tout le concept de Jeff se basait sur l'observation que<sb>le simple fait de se trouver près d'un personnage en VR pouvait créer<sb>une expérience intense.<sb>Enfin, on voulait que le joueur comprenne tout de suite l'attitude du zombie aveugle.<sb>Est-ce qu'il est en colère ? Est-ce qu'il a entendu quelque chose et qu'il est curieux ? Etc.<sb>Le premier personnage qu'on a modélisé et animé était une sorte de robot ouvrier du Cartel.<sb>Le visage du robot comportait un affichage holographique qui prenait<sb>la forme de différentes icônes représentant son état.<sb>Une grande barre d'armature dépassait à l'arrière de sa tête, émettant<sb>des étincelles et de la fumée.<sb>Le but était d'indiquer que ses capteurs visuels étaient endommagés,<sb>ce qui le rendait aveugle.<sb>Le robot était grand et massif.<sb>Il avait l'air lourd, imprévisible et dangereux.<sb>Cependant, les réactions des joueurs à ce design robotique ont mis<sb>en évidence des problèmes.<sb>Les joueurs regardaient d'abord l'affichage holographique de la tête.<sb>Pour eux, il était trop difficile d'analyser et de comprendre le sens<sb>des icônes. Pire encore, l'élément d'affichage détournait leur attention<sb>de la barre de fer plantée dans la tête du robot, ce qui les empêchait<sb>de comprendre qu'il était aveugle.<sb>Les joueurs trouvaient le robot imposant, mais on n'avait pas la réaction<sb>de peur viscérale qu'on souhaitait.<sb>Alors, on a repris la planche à dessin pour créer le personnage<sb>plus organique que vous voyez devant vous.<sb>En s'inspirant des mineurs de charbon qui mouraient de l'anthracose, on a<sb>imaginé un membre d'une équipe de nettoyage du Cartel qui aurait succombé<sb>à l'infection xenienne.<sb>Ça a produit chez les joueurs la réaction viscérale qu'on recherchait.<sb>Un visage humain est toujours visible, mais les yeux sont clairement<sb>détruits, indiquant ainsi qu'il est aveugle.<sb>La nature organique de ce design nous a permis de nous appuyer davantage<sb>sur l'audio pour communiquer le comportement du personnage, avec<sb>des grognements, des rugissements bestiaux, mais aussi des sons plus humains<sb>qu'on a rajoutés progressivement.
Les casse-tête électriques sont un outil de design assez pratique car ils<sb>forcent le joueur à se déplacer dans l'environnement tout en utilisant<sb>l'outil multifonction avec sa main principale.<sb>Ici, le joueur doit pointer la lampe torche pour se déplacer,<sb>se téléporter avec sa main secondaire, se couvrir la bouche pour s'empêcher<sb>de tousser, suivre les câbles avec l'outil multifonction, et potentiellement<sb>ramasser des bouteilles avec ses gants antigravités.<sb>Le joueur doit faire des choix dans sa progression car le design l'empêche<sb>de tout faire en même temps avec ses deux mains.<sb>Les joueurs à une main sont encore plus submergés<sb>par ces nombreuses tâches.<sb>C'est pourquoi, dans la distillerie, on a placé beaucoup de masques qu'ils<sb>peuvent placer sur leur visage pour ne pas avoir à utiliser une main<sb>pour s'empêcher de tousser.<sb>Ce casse-tête électrique a été modifié plusieurs fois, et dans certaines<sb>de ses versions, le joueur devait le résoudre pendant que Jeff<sb>se promenait dans la zone.<sb>Mais dans cette scène, les joueurs devaient gérer trop d'éléments<sb>à la fois, et leur peur de Jeff s'est vite changée en frustration.<sb>La solution consistait à enfermer Jeff pendant que les joueurs résolvaient<sb>le casse-tête, les rugissements au loin entretenant une certaine tension.<sb>Ensuite, le problème était de savoir comment libérer Jeff<sb>pour reprendre la progression.<sb>On a d'abord pensé que Jeff pouvait sortir tout seul de la chambre froide<sb>une fois le casse-tête résolu, mais ça semblait trop artificiel et scripté<sb>par rapport à une libération par le joueur.<sb>La mécanique du casse-tête électrique nous donnait une solution logique<sb>au problème, avec en plus l'avantage de créer un moment de tension<sb>pour le joueur quand il comprend qu'il va devoir rouvrir la porte<sb>de la chambre froide et libérer Jeff pour pouvoir continuer.
Une grande partie de nos idées pour Jeff consistaient, de façon<sb>plausible, à le forcer lui et le joueur à occuper un espace exigu au même moment.<sb>On a tout de suite pensé à un voyage en ascenseur, mais on n'était<sb>pas sûrs qu'en pratique, ça fonctionne très bien.<sb>Le problème était aussi que cette séquence pouvait s'avérer techniquement<sb>gourmande à réaliser.<sb>Notre premier prototype était extrêmement rudimentaire.<sb>Le joueur montait dans un ascenseur avec Jeff, le voyage durait à peu près<sb>30 secondes, et le joueur et Jeff en sortaient.<sb>Il n'y avait aucun script de niveau complexe, aucune animation sur-mesure<sb>pour Jeff ni aucun traitement de lumière ou effet audio spécial.<sb>Malgré ce relatif manque de sophistication, les joueurs ont très bien<sb>réagi à la séquence. Quand on a lancé les tests à l'échelle<sb>de l'entreprise, ils la considéraient même comme un moment clé.<sb>Ça nous a convaincus que ça valait la peine de travailler davantage<sb>le passage dans l'ascenseur pour en faire quelque chose de vraiment spécial.<sb>Finalement, on a fait intervenir beaucoup de disciplines différentes<sb>pour créer la séquence définitive, qui allie son, animation,<sb>éclairages scriptés et chorégraphie précise des mouvements de Jeff<sb>et des actions du joueur.
La plupart du temps, les bruits qui attirent Jeff sont générés par<sb>le joueur qui, soit tente activement de l'attirer à un nouvel endroit,<sb>soit commet une maladresse bruyante qui aurait pu être évitée.<sb>L'important, c'est que le joueur se sente dans une certaine mesure<sb>responsable des bruits générés.<sb>L'objectif du couloir qui suit est de produire l'effet inverse, du moins momentanément.<sb>Tel un petit animal ingérable, ce crabe de tête audacieux apparaît pour<sb>surprendre et agacer le joueur en renversant toute une série de bouteilles<sb>avant de s'enfuir dans un conduit de ventilation.<sb>Fichu crabe de tête !<sb>On a été surpris de voir que beaucoup de joueurs<sb>voulaient vérifier s'il s'était bien enfui.<sb>Ils grimpaient sur les caisses et tendaient le cou pour voir dans les conduits.<sb>C'est ce qui nous a donné l'idée d'ajouter une petite surprise<sb>pour récompenser ces joueurs.<sb>Essayez, vous verrez que le crabe de tête audacieux s'est effectivement<sb>échappé pour revenir à la charge un de ces quatre.<sb>Le coût de l'intégration de ce genre de secrets doit également être évalué<sb>en fonction de la probabilité que le joueur les trouve.<sb>En l'occurrence, suite à nos observations en tests, cet ajout en valait<sb>la peine, surtout parce qu'il renforçait le réalisme de l'univers, l'idée<sb>d'un monde cohérent dans lequel des créatures vivantes mènent<sb>leur existence même si le joueur n'est pas là pour les voir.
Le principe de Jeff étant basé sur l'idée de maintenir une proximité<sb>étroite entre lui et le joueur, la carte de la distillerie a été<sb>conçue comme une série de salles connectées par des transitions à sens unique.<sb>Très tôt, on a utilisé deux techniques conjointement pour garder Jeff<sb>et le joueur ensemble dans tout le niveau.<sb>D'abord, chaque nouvelle zone était séparée de la suivante par une porte spéciale verrouillée.<sb>Ces portes prenaient la forme de « membranes xeniennes » impénétrables<sb>que seul Jeff pouvait déchirer.<sb>Le joueur attirait Jeff jusqu'à la membrane en faisant du bruit,<sb>Jeff la détruisait, et le joueur et lui pouvaient continuer.<sb>On a toujours voulu que les testeurs décrivent Jeff comme un adversaire,<sb>comme un poursuivant inlassable ou une sorte<cr>d'« épine dans le pied ».<sb>Le problème du concept de la membrane xenienne était qu'il conduisait<sb>les joueurs à décrire Jeff comme un outil bien pratique, ou pire, comme<sb>un « partenaire en colère », plutôt que comme un ennemi redoutable.<sb>Un autre moyen de maintenir Jeff et le joueur ensemble consistait<sb>à utiliser des passages à sens unique, comme des chutes.<sb>Jeff tombait des passerelles, des plateformes et des échelles<sb>dans chaque nouvelle zone.<sb>Ces chutes fonctionnaient comme prévu, mais tout comme les membranes<sb>xeniennes, elles généraient une réaction indésirable chez les joueurs,<sb>surtout lorsqu'elles se répétaient.<sb>En regardant Jeff tomber, les joueurs avaient l'impression qu'il était moins dangereux.<sb>Ils avaient pitié, et parfois même ils se moquaient de lui.<sb>Finalement, on s'est rendu compte qu'on pouvait utiliser les champs<sb>de force du Cartel, que le joueur ne pouvait <I>pas<I> traverser, comme moyen<sb>de créer des « portes sélectives ». Ces champs de force permettaient à Jeff<sb>de passer, mais le joueur devait suivre un autre chemin à sens unique.<sb>Ça nous a permis de créer des phases où Jeff et le joueur pouvaient<sb>progresser ensemble tout en éliminant le problème des membranes xeniennes,<sb>et en évitant les chutes répétées qui pouvaient ridiculiser Jeff.<sb>Les champs de force du Cartel présentaient aussi plusieurs autres avantages.<sb>D'une part, ils donnaient à Jeff un moyen bien pratique de prendre<sb>un chemin « en coulisses » inaccessible au joueur, comme celui qui se trouve<sb>au bas de cette échelle.<sb>D'autre part, ils étaient cohérents avec l'histoire de Jeff,<sb>qui est un ancien membre d'une équipe de nettoyage du Cartel.
La création d'une expérience aussi fortement axée sur l'audio a posé<sb>des problèmes de design uniques.<sb>Le principal défi consistait à déterminer quels sons Jeff devait être<sb>capable d'entendre et à s'assurer que les joueurs comprenaient les règles.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> comporte un très grand nombre d'objets physiques.<sb>Cependant, les tests nous ont permis de constater qu'il valait mieux<sb>n'en utiliser qu'une petite partie dans la distillerie.<sb>Il fallait qu'on porte une attention particulière à chaque objet intégré<sb>pour des questions d'audio, en raison des collisions entre les objets<sb>et les différents types de surface utilisés dans la distillerie.<sb>Il était important que ce que le joueur entende corresponde à ses attentes<sb>en ce qui concerne les réactions de Jeff.<sb>Lors des premiers tests, dans certains cas, les joueurs disaient<sb>des choses comme « je ne sais pas pourquoi Jeff s'est énervé », ou<sb>« je m'attendais à ce que ce bruit attire Jeff ». Au fil du temps, on a<sb>identifié ces cas d'incertitude et on les a traités un par un.<sb>Il était essentiel que les joueurs soient toujours capables d'identifier<sb>la cause et l'effet d'un bruit susceptible d'attirer Jeff.<sb>En cas d'échec, les joueurs avaient l'impression que Jeff agissait<sb>au hasard et ils se sentaient frustrés.<sb>Dans ce domaine, certaines de nos expériences ont échoué.<sb>À un moment, certaines parties du niveau étaient jonchées de verre brisé<sb>qui faisait du bruit si les joueurs marchaient<sb>ou se téléportaient dessus.<sb>Ils étaient ensuite surpris lorsque Jeff attaquait car peu d'entre eux<sb>remarquaient le verre brisé. Ce concept a donc été retiré pour éviter toute confusion.<sb>Il fallait aussi faire attention à éviter l'excès inverse, où les joueurs<sb>s'attendraient à ce que des éléments purement cosmétiques puissent faire du bruit.<sb>Par exemple, à un moment donné, on avait placé des flaques d'eau<sb>sur le carrelage du sol.<sb>Visuellement, c'était vraiment cool, mais ça a troublé certains<sb>de nos testeurs qui pensaient que Jeff allait entendre le bruit de leurs pas<sb>dans les flaques d'eau, alors qu'on n'avait jamais voulu que ce soit le cas.
La conclusion du périple du joueur dans la distillerie a généré beaucoup<sb>de discussions sur ce que les joueurs allaient finalement ressentir à propos de Jeff.<sb>L'observation des tests nous avait montré que la plupart des joueurs<sb>voulaient simplement qu'il meure, généralement dès qu'ils le rencontraient.<sb>Mais certains d'entre eux avaient aussi pitié de lui et ne voulaient pas<sb>forcément qu'il meure.<sb>Dans notre première version de la fin, le joueur, par ses actions,<sb>provoquait involontairement la mort de Jeff qui se faisait attaquer<sb>et emporter par des fourmis-lions.<sb>L'objectif était en partie de montrer que les fourmis-lions étaient encore<sb>plus puissantes que Jeff, ce qui créait une certaine tension juste avant<sb>que le joueur n'aille lui-même affronter les fourmis-lions.<sb>Cependant, cette conclusion laissait un peu les joueurs sur leur faim.<sb>Ils ne se sentaient pas responsables de la disparition de Jeff et voulaient<sb>être impliqués plus directement.<sb>Dans une fin tragique pour Jeff, certainement.<sb>De plus, on ne satisfaisait pas non plus les joueurs qui éprouvaient<sb>de la pitié pour Jeff et ne voulaient pas nécessairement le voir mourir.<sb>Il y avait aussi d'autres problèmes.<sb>L'attaque des fourmis-lions semblait aléatoire pour beaucoup de joueurs,<sb>ce qui atténuait son impact.<sb>Et comme la mort de Jeff n'était pas montrée, les joueurs avaient<sb>un sentiment d'inachevé.<sb>Ça les empêchait de passer à autre chose et de se préparer<sb>à aller affronter les fourmis-lions.<sb>Le compacteur d'ordures était la solution à tous ces problèmes.<sb>Il donnait au joueur la possibilité de décider du sort de Jeff et d'avoir<sb>un sentiment de conclusion, qu'il décide de l'écraser ou simplement<sb>de le laisser enfermé.<sb>Malgré ça, il faut bien admettre que la plupart des joueurs écrasaient<sb>Jeff sans aucune hésitation. Les monstres.
Dans certaines de nos premières tentatives pour adapter en VR des ennemis<sb>issus de <I>Half-Life 2<I>, on avait constaté que les fourmis-lions semblaient<sb>particulièrement prometteuses et intéressantes à combattre,<sb>mais qu'elles avaient tendance à submerger rapidement les testeurs.<sb>Elles réussissaient à entrer trop rapidement dans l'espace physique<sb>des joueurs, et elles leur mettaient une telle pression qu'ils finissaient<sb>par se téléporter sans arrêt pour essayer de s'échapper.<sb>À peu près au même moment, on a découvert que tous les joueurs, même<sb>relativement novices, visaient étonnamment bien en VR.<sb>La variabilité de la capacité de visée entre les joueurs est<sb>tout simplement beaucoup plus faible en VR par rapport aux jeux<sb>à la souris et au clavier.<sb>Pour exploiter le fait que les joueurs sont beaucoup plus précis au tir,<sb>on a commencé à faire des tests avec un type de fourmi-lion<sb>que les joueurs pouvaient ralentir en tirant sur ses pattes.<sb>Les testeurs appréciaient à la fois la contrainte de précision<sb>et la sensation organique qu'ils ressentaient quand les pattes s'arrachaient<sb>et que la fourmi-lion blessée continuait à ramper vers eux.<sb>La nécessité de viser les pattes était évidente pour le joueur, mais on a eu<sb>beaucoup de mal à lui faire comprendre que l'abdomen était invulnérable<sb>tant que les pattes n'étaient pas détruites.<sb>Pour communiquer efficacement cette mécanique aux testeurs, il n'y avait<sb>pas de solution unique, mais plutôt une série de petits éléments<sb>qui faisaient passer le message.<sb>Par exemple, on a donné à l'abdomen une couleur terne et noire<sb>quand il est  invulnérable, et quand il devient vulnérable, on a changé<sb>cette couleur pour qu'elle corresponde aux pattes orange vif.<sb>Tirer sur les parties blindées de la fourmi-lion générait des étincelles<sb>et des bruits de ricochet, alors que tirer sur les parties vulnérables<sb>provoquait des giclées de sang orange et des bruits d'impact plus sourds.<sb>On a également conçu les animations pour bien souligner l'explosion de<sb>l'abdomen, et on a fait en sorte qu'il reste un morceau d'abdomen explosé<sb>après la mort de la fourmi-lion.
Toute la végétation du jeu s'anime en réponse au toucher du joueur<sb>et aux conditions de vent de l'environnement.<sb>L'animation du feuillage est entièrement procédurale et calculée par<sb>le processeur graphique au moyen de la déformation par vertex shader.<sb>Un volume de voxels qui suit le corps du joueur permet de suivre<sb>la position des mains du joueur dans l'espace.<sb>Dans ce volume de voxels, les mains génèrent des traînées qui peuvent être<sb>reprises par le vertex shader du feuillage et utilisées pour créer<sb>des déformations, ce qui permet au joueur de déplacer le feuillage par ses gestes.<sb>Le feuillage interagit également avec le vent, ce qui nous permet<sb>de donner un mouvement d'ambiance aux plantes.<sb>Pour pouvoir recréer toute une gamme de conditions environnementales, on a<sb>généré les déformations dues au vent à différentes vitesses,<sb>de la brise légère au souffle d'un ouragan.<sb>Toutefois, il s'est avéré que les conditions environnementales dans le jeu<sb>ne nécessitaient jamais plus qu'un vent faible, et les effets d'ouragan<sb>ont rarement été utilisés dans le développement.<sb>Cet habitat de zoo a été ajouté tardivement et a nécessité une mise à jour<sb>importante du système d'animation procédural du feuillage.<sb>Avant d'ajouter cet habitat, on n'avait pas besoin de déformer<sb>le feuillage en réponse aux animations des ennemis ou aux explosions<sb>des grenades, mais dans cette zone, justement, il faut lancer des grenades sur des zombies.<sb>Pour répondre à ce besoin, on a ajouté un volume de voxels basse<sb>résolution pouvant être repris par le shader du feuillage pour appliquer<sb>des déformations supplémentaires.<sb>Ce volume de voxels basse résolution est d'environ un pied cube par voxel.<sb>Il est fixé dans l'espace et s'étend dans tout l'habitat.<sb>Par comparaison, le volume de voxels qui se déplace avec le joueur<sb>est d'environ deux pouces cubes par voxel.<sb>Les ennemis et les grenades dans cet espace peuvent créer des traînées<sb>et des impacts dans le volume de voxels basse résolution, qui sont ensuite<sb>interprétés par le shader du feuillage comme des forces éoliennes.<sb>C'est là que la préparation rencontre l'opportunité.<sb>Quand les grenades explosent, elles créent des vents localisés de la force d'un ouragan.
Il y avait très peu de sons de fourmis-lions existants quand on a commencé<sb>à travailler sur <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>. Contrairement à la plupart des créatures<sb>de <I>Half-Life<I>, qui utilisaient souvent des sons hérités, presque tous<sb>les sons des fourmis-lions étaient complètement nouveaux.<sb>En partant quasiment de zéro, on s'est inspirés du comportement<sb>des fourmis-lions pour concevoir leurs sons.<sb>Étant donné que les fourmis-lions attaquent par vagues, il nous a semblé<sb>probable qu'elles communiquent et s'organisent en groupes.<sb>Cette idée nous a conduits à intégrer des sons complexes de cliquetis<sb>d'insectes, dont la version finale commençait par des enregistrements<sb>d'étourneaux sansonnets, qui se sont révélés plus variés et plus originaux<sb>que les enregistrements d'insectes.<sb>Ici, vous pouvez entendre les chants originaux de l'étourneau sansonnet.<sb><wait:13>On a pris ces enregistrements et on les a mixés avec des éléments<sb>artificiels pour créer les sons de fourmis-lions utilisés dans le jeu.
Dans les jeux traditionnels, les commandes analogiques comme les leviers,<sb>les cadrans et les manivelles déclenchent généralement des animations<sb>simples en réponse à un clic de souris ou à la pression d'une touche.<sb>En VR, toutefois, les joueurs disposant de contrôleurs à détection<sb>de mains s'attendent à pouvoir manipuler les interfaces analogiques<sb>en les saisissant et en les déplaçant directement.<sb>On a donc développé un nouveau système baptisé « Anim Interactables »<sb>(objets interactifs animés). Le mécanisme d'ouverture de ce poste de soins<sb>est un bon exemple d'Anim Interactable.<sb>À gauche et à droite, vous pouvez voir d'autres exemples, comme<sb>une commande d'aiguillage de chemin de fer, la sonnette de la porte<sb>du Vortigaunt, une manivelle, une porte d'armoire coulissante,<sb>et l'antenne et le bouton de réglage de la radio.<sb>Les Anim Interactables de ce type nous permettent de donner au joueur<sb>le contrôle des interfaces analogiques tout en limitant l'input<sb>à certains types de mouvements.<sb>Le système utilise la position et l'orientation de la main du joueur pour<sb>gérer l'animation d'un modèle qui utilise l'interface analogique.<sb>Lorsque le joueur déplace son contrôleur à détection de mouvements, l'Anim<sb>Interactable analyse le mouvement pour déterminer si l'exécution<sb>de l'animation à l'endroit ou à l'envers place le point d'interaction<sb>plus près de la position du contrôleur dans l'espace.<sb>Ça permet au joueur de faire avancer l'animation, de l'exécuter<sb>à l'envers ou de maintenir sa position.<sb>On obtient ainsi une correspondance intuitive entre le corps du joueur et l'interface virtuelle.<sb>De plus, ces animations interactives ne doivent pas nécessairement avoir<sb>une logique physique ; il suffit aux graphistes d'animer l'amplitude<sb>de mouvement qu'ils veulent que le joueur puisse contrôler.<sb>Les visualisations de débogage de ces Anim Interactables sont activées,<sb>ce qui vous permet de voir l'amplitude de mouvement possible, ainsi que<sb>les trajectoires non linéaires utilisées pour l'aiguillage, le poste de soins et la manivelle.<sb>Les Anim Interactables nous ont permis de rendre interactifs toutes sortes<sb>d'objets dans le monde, des appareils les plus banals fabriqués<sb>par l'homme aux mécanismes complexes du Cartel, sans qu'il soit nécessaire<sb>d'effectuer des simulations physiques complexes.<sb>N'hésitez pas à jouer avec les Anim Interactables dans cette zone avant de passer à la suite.
Parfois, des sections de niveau importantes sont déplacées ou réordonnées<sb>à mesure que nous travaillons sur le jeu.<sb>C'est le cas pour toute cette zone et le casse-tête électrique<sb>autour duquel elle est centrée.<sb>En fait, pendant longtemps cette zone n'était même pas intégrée dans le jeu ;<sb>à l'origine, elle avait été créée pour tester notre prototype<sb>de casse-tête électrique.<sb>En quelques mois, on a développé la mécanique basique des casse-tête<sb>électriques, et on l'a expérimentée dans une série de petits niveaux de test.<sb>Chaque niveau de test se focalisait sur un concept de gameplay unique.<sb>Par exemple, l'utilisation du casse-tête électrique pour attirer<sb>l'attention du joueur sur quelque chose d'intéressant, comme la flore et la faune xenienne.<sb>Ou l'intégration de moments surprenants, comme un crabe de tête qui surgit<sb>d'un conduit de ventilation.<sb>Ou encore, l'action de glisser le bras et la main derrière des tuyaux<sb>ou dans des espaces restreints.<sb>Après avoir choisi les idées qui fonctionnaient bien, on les combinait<sb>dans un seul niveau de test avec un casse-tête électrique qui connectait<sb>tous ces concepts en un seul casse-tête.<sb>D'autres tests dans ce niveau nous ont convaincus que les casse-tête<sb>électriques devaient être intégrés et on a commencé à les ajouter<sb>dans d'autres zones, mais le niveau de test lui-même ne trouvait pas sa place dans le jeu.<sb>Ce n'est que plus tard qu'il est devenu évident que le zoo avait besoin<sb>d'une cassure dans son rythme.<sb>On est très attentifs à la fatigue du joueur lors des tests de jeu<sb>et on essaie de repérer les moments où il aurait besoin d'un casse-tête,<sb>ou d'une phase d'exploration ou de collecte de ressources pour se reposer des combats.<sb>Le besoin de repos était important vers la fin du niveau du zoo, et on a<sb>donc pu utiliser le niveau du prototype de casse-tête électrique qui était déjà conçu.
Quand on a décidé de ressusciter ce niveau de test pour ralentir le rythme<sb>du zoo, on a eu l'occasion d'apporter des améliorations et d'intégrer<sb>des éléments qui n'existaient pas au moment où on commençait à faire<sb>des expérimentations sur le casse-tête électrique.<sb>Par exemple, les boursoufleurs, des ennemis xeniens explosifs qu'on venait<sb>de développer, ont été ajoutés à différents stades du casse-tête pour<sb>surprendre les joueurs et leur rappeler de rester vigilants.<sb>Et en plusieurs mois, la mécanique du casse-tête électrique elle-même<sb>avait évolué pour passer d'un système où le joueur poussait une boule<sb>d'énergie sur un parcours, à un système comprenant des embranchements<sb>et des jonctions pivotantes.<sb>La jonction qu'on voit ici dans le tableau électrique est l'élément<sb>central du casse-tête, car le joueur doit interagir avec elle trois fois :<sb>une fois pour ouvrir la porte roulante vers cette zone arrière, une fois<sb>pour rediriger le courant de la porte roulante vers la dernière étape<sb>du casse-tête, et une fois pour rouvrir la porte roulante afin de sortir.<sb>Comme ce casse-tête électrique s'étale sur une vaste zone, et qu'il y a<sb>même un combat contre des zombies en plein milieu, les joueurs oubliaient<sb>souvent le lien entre l'orientation de cette jonction et la porte roulante.<sb>Ça voulait dire qu'ils se piégeaient ici eux-mêmes et ne comprenaient pas comment continuer.<sb>Pour résoudre ce problème, on a apporté de nombreuses modifications<sb>à la présentation de cette jonction au cours du développement.<sb>L'unique tableau électrique et l'enchevêtrement de conduits sont conçus<sb>pour qu'on puisse reconnaître que c'est la même jonction des deux côtés du mur.<sb>La forme du trou dans le mur et l'orientation du tableau électrique sont<sb>conçues pour faire en sorte que le joueur soit bien placé pour voir<sb>la porte roulante, et pour la voir se fermer quand il redirige le courant<sb>vers la dernière étape du casse-tête.<sb>La porte elle-même fait beaucoup de bruit et génère énormément<sb>d'étincelles pour attirer l'attention à chaque fois qu'elle s'active.<sb>Pendant longtemps, ce casse-tête a failli être retiré, mais grâce<sb>aux améliorations apportées, les testeurs qui comprenaient son fonctionnement<sb>étaient finalement assez nombreux pour qu'on puisse l'intégrer dans la version finale.
La sortie du zoo nous donnait l'opportunité d'offrir aux joueurs une vue<sb>impressionnante et de leur montrer le chemin parcouru pour atteindre la chambre forte.<sb>Cette scène était compliquée à réaliser car on avait décidé que<sb>la chambre forte se trouverait au-dessus du parking que le joueur atteignait<sb>à la fin de la carte.<sb>Mais si on plaçait la chambre forte correctement à l'endroit prévu,<sb>elle semblait trop éloignée pour créer la vue spectaculaire<sb>qu'on voulait ici.<sb>On voulait aussi montrer la déconnexion des câbles d'alimentation<sb>par les Vortigaunts à ce moment-là, mais le fait que la chambre forte soit<sb>aussi éloignée rendait la scène peu claire pour les testeurs.<sb>La solution était de tout rapprocher.<sb>La chambre forte semblait plus imposante. Elle dominait le joueur<sb>et la destruction des câbles par les Vortigaunts était bien plus visible.<sb>Il nous restait à trouver un concept pour justifier les deux positions<sb>de la chambre forte : ici au début de la carte, et la position éventuelle<sb>à la fin de la carte.<sb>Lors de cette phase de développement, nous étions en train de définir<sb>exactement comment le joueur allait faire tomber la chambre forte,<sb>et notre solution à ce problème permettait aussi de justifier<sb>ses deux positions.<sb>Les rayons tracteurs sont un poncif de la science-fiction. Ils partagent<sb>souvent un style visuel commun : celui d'un champ de force enveloppant,<sb>émis à partir d'un seul point à la manière d'un filet.<sb>Ici, l'utilisation d'un rayon tracteur comme dispositif de sécurité<sb>du Cartel nous arrangeait bien.<sb>Elle nous permettait d'éviter qu'Alyx se fasse écraser par la chambre<sb>forte quand les Vortigaunts détachaient le dernier câble d'alimentation,<sb>et elle nous donnait une bonne raison de déplacer la chambre forte<sb>à l'endroit où nous voulions qu'elle se trouve à la fin de la carte.<sb>Tout au long de la carte, le rayon tracteur lui-même sert de point<sb>de repère permettant au joueur de reconnaître à tout moment<sb>son nouvel objectif : le poste de contrôle d'où il provient.
Le dernier rebondissement du jeu présentait un certain nombre de défis<sb>narratifs pour les auteurs.<sb>Le jeu est long
beaucoup plus long qu'un film
et il semblait presque<sb>impossible de réussir à garder la surprise du G-man jusqu'à la fin de l'expérience.<sb>Tout le monde dans l'équipe pensait qu'avec un minimum de réflexion,<sb>la plupart des joueurs allaient découvrir la vérité en cours de route.<sb>Comme dans beaucoup de bonnes histoires, la solution consistait donc<sb>à ajouter des choses : plus de détails, plus de questions et plus<sb>de circonvolutions dans l'intrigue.<sb>Les auteurs se sont vite rendu compte qu'il y avait un nom important<sb>
Gordon Freeman
qui interpellait le joueur et le détournait<sb>de toutes les théories qu'il pouvait élaborer seul.<sb>On a ensuite compris qu'on pouvait utiliser l'absence du G-man<sb>dans l'histoire et les parallèles troublants entre le G-man et les expériences<sb>de Gordon à Black Mesa pour réorienter l'attention du joueur, et propulser<sb>l'histoire vers son dernier acte.<sb>Si le joueur pensait avoir découvert une nouvelle mission qui consistait<sb>à libérer Gordon Freeman de sa stase, alors la surprise à la fin était garantie.<sb>Pour y parvenir, les auteurs ont créé un nouveau personnage mystérieux :<sb>une scientifique qui collabore avec le Cartel.<sb>Cet ajout a été effectué tard dans le projet, c'est pourquoi les auteurs<sb>se sont appuyés sur une technique à l'efficacité éprouvée :<sb>créer le personnage pour une comédienne qu'on adorait, et faire notre maximum<sb>pour travailler avec elle.<sb>Pour les auteurs, la comédienne choisie possédait un ton particulier :<sb>elle avait une voix naturelle et assurée, marquée par un accent traînant du Missouri.<sb>Non seulement ça la distinguait des autres personnages de l'univers<sb><I>Half-Life<I>, mais en plus, ça permettait d'imaginer facilement la voix<sb>du personnage à partir du script, ce qui est incroyablement important<sb>quand on manque de temps à la fin d'un projet.<sb>Et une fois en studio, sa performance parfaite nous a rassurés sur le fait<sb>qu'on avait fait les bons choix de design.<sb>Bien sûr, il fallait encore créer la scène.<sb>Les concepteurs de niveaux ont choisi une section du parcours à supprimer<sb>pour insérer la scène.<sb>La zone choisie contenait auparavant des bernacles et quelques éléments<sb>de casse-tête auxquels les concepteurs n'étaient pas trop attachés.<sb>Le parcours devait être modifié pour orienter le joueur vers un endroit<sb>d'où il pouvait assister à la scène sans avoir un bon visuel sur le personnage.<sb>Ça offrait deux avantages. D'une part, l'impression d'espionner<sb>la conversation et le fait de ne pas connaître l'identité du personnage<sb>renforçaient le mystère.<sb>D'autre part, on pouvait également éviter de montrer le personnage<sb>et les animations faciales complexes nécessaires pour lui donner vie.<sb>Ça épargnait du travail aux animateurs et aux chorégraphes.<sb>Comme dans beaucoup de cas, <I>ne pas<I> faire le travail était la meilleure<sb>chose à faire, à la fois pour l'histoire <I>et<I> pour notre planning extrêmement serré.
Le but de cette cachette était de donner aux joueurs une belle récompense<sb>pour avoir observé et exploré l'environnement.<sb>On voulait mettre en avant la condition des pillards qui vivent<sb>derrière le mur de quarantaine, montrer à quoi leur vie pouvait ressembler<sb>et pourquoi ils pouvaient choisir d'y vivre.<sb>En interne, on avait baptisé la personne qui vit ici<cr>« le tueur<sb>du Cartel ». On imaginait quelqu'un qui en voulait au Cartel et qui avait<sb>choisi de vivre dans la zone de quarantaine pour exercer sa vengeance<sb>sur des patrouilles sans méfiance, et qui finissait peut-être même<sb>par rejoindre la résistance telle qu'elle est décrite dans <I>Half-Life 2<I>.
Depuis quelques années, le streaming de jeux vidéo est devenu l'un<sb>des principaux moyens pour les joueurs de s'impliquer dans la culture<sb>vidéoludique. C'est encore plus vrai pour les titres en VR,<sb>qui peuvent être vus par les joueurs qui n'ont pas l'équipement VR.<sb>Pour nous adresser à ce public, nous avons créé un écran spectateur<sb>qui affiche la santé du joueur en VR, ses munitions, sa résine et le contenu de ses poches de poignet.<sb>Ces informations se superposent à l'affichage 3D du jeu dans la fenêtre<sb>du bureau. Elles permettent au spectateur de suivre l'état des ressources<sb>du joueur sans avoir à attendre que ce dernier regarde son poignet ou ouvre le menu.<sb>Au départ, l'écran spectateur était un outil utilisé par l'équipe<sb>de développement pour afficher les ressources, l'état des boutons<sb>du contrôleur ainsi que d'autres informations de diagnostic.<sb>Un effet secondaire intéressant de cet écran était qu'il rendait les tests<sb>beaucoup plus intéressants à regarder, parce qu'en tant que public,<sb>nous avions des informations dont le joueur n'était pas<sb>nécessairement conscient.<sb>Par exemple, les observateurs des tests pouvaient se rendre compte<sb>qu'un joueur avait failli succomber à une rencontre, alors que le joueur<sb>lui-même n'avait même pas vérifié son état de santé.<sb>On a même vu des cas où des joueurs achevaient un ennemi avec leur toute<sb>dernière balle sans s'en rendre compte eux-mêmes.<sb>Les bons moments qu'on a passés en regardant nos propres tests étaient<sb>quelque chose qu'on voulait partager avec le public de streaming,<sb>et c'était intéressant de voir des streamers s'approprier cette interface.
L'ajout d'un combat spécial pour conclure l'affrontement contre<sb>les fourmis-lions posait des difficultés de design importantes.<sb>On voulait créer une phase de combat soutenue qui soit assez intense<sb>pour donner du fil à retordre aux joueurs qui avaient développé<sb>leurs compétences contre les fourmis-lions.<sb>Mais le simple fait de lâcher un grand nombre de fourmis-lions<sb>d'un seul coup sur le joueur n'était pas une expérience particulièrement engageante<sb>ni compatible avec l'équilibre<sb>qu'on voulait maintenir dans les combats.<sb>Plutôt que de confiner le joueur dans un espace restreint et de générer<sb>des vagues d'ennemis, on a voulu qu'il continue à progresser vers<sb>un objectif tout en étant soumis à une pression constante.<sb>Pour ça, on avait besoin d'une arène linéaire avec une configuration<sb>poreuse qui permettrait au joueur de garder son objectif en ligne de mire<sb>pendant qu'il se faisait encercler par des essaims de fourmis-lions<sb>tout au long de sa progression.<sb>Ce dépôt ferroviaire, qu'on avait conçu à l'origine pour une scène<sb>narrative retirée du jeu, avait les caractéristiques recherchées.<sb>Les grands wagons sont alignés dans le sens de la progression, et leur<sb>positionnement nécessite que le joueur fasse attention à ses flancs<sb>et à ses arrières en avançant.<sb>La tour du rayon tracteur du Cartel est visible au bout des voies, ce qui<sb>donne au joueur un objectif clair.<sb>Le positionnement du néon rouge dans la direction du rayon tracteur était<sb>également voulu. C'est une technique utilisée par les concepteurs<sb>d'environnements pour attirer inconsciemment les joueurs dans la bonne<sb>direction par contraste visuel, même s'ils perdent momentanément<sb>leurs repères dans le chaos du combat.<sb>Le rythme du combat a été soigneusement équilibré pour que la plupart<sb>des testeurs se sentent presque dépassés, avant d'avoir l'impression<sb>de s'en être sortis de justesse.<sb>Il a fallu de nombreux tests de positionnement des ennemis, munitions<sb>et objets, et de nombreuses modifications du parcours pour atteindre cet équilibre.<sb>On a finalement opté pour un design permettant un flux constant<sb>de fourmis-lions, avec des fourmis-lions cracheuses placées à l'autre bout<sb>de la zone afin d'exercer une pression suffisante pour empêcher le joueur<sb>de se précipiter vers l'objectif.<sb>Les soldats du Cartel placés sur les plateformes surélevées détournent<sb>l'attention du joueur vers le côté droit et apportent de la verticalité<sb>dans la hiérarchisation des cibles, ce qui intensifie le sentiment<sb>de frénésie qu'on a cherché à créer.
L'objectif de ce casse-tête était de créer un moment de stress intense<sb>en obligeant le joueur à gérer une menace soudaine après avoir été placé<sb>dans une position désavantageuse.<sb>Dans la version originale du casse-tête, les joueurs étaient sur<sb>une plateforme suspendue à un câble et devaient se tracter au-dessus du vide.<sb>À mi-chemin, des fourmis-lions cracheuses arrivaient et commençaient à attaquer.<sb>La plateforme offrait une protection limitée et les joueurs devaient<sb>alterner entre se mettre à couvert et continuer à se tracter vers l'avant.<sb>Ça permettait de créer le pic d'intensité souhaité,<sb>mais malheureusement, le mouvement latéral de la plateforme provoquait<sb>une cinétose très marquée chez la plupart des testeurs.<sb>Même les joueurs qui étaient à l'aise avec le mouvement vertical<sb>des ascenseurs à d'autres endroits du jeu étaient affectés ici.<sb>Le casse-tête retenu conserve le même sentiment de tension dû au fait<sb>d'être bloqué au-dessus du vide en se faisant attaquer, mais il ne se base<sb>pas sur le mouvement physique du joueur.<sb>La partie supérieure de la plateforme en bois est délibérément dépourvue<sb>de toute protection substantielle, ce qui encourage les joueurs à sauter<sb>sur les plateformes situées en dessous.<sb>Sur les plateformes inférieures, on fournit une couverture suffisante pour<sb>protéger le joueur des fourmis-lions, tout en lui laissant une impression<sb>de vulnérabilité au milieu du vide.<sb>Ici, les protections sont poreuses et cassables, ce qui intensifie<sb>le sentiment d'urgence et oblige les joueurs à attaquer les fourmis-lions<sb>depuis une position précaire.
Dans les cas où le joueur devait affronter le Cartel dans des espaces<sb>relativement ouverts comme celui-ci, on a souvent constaté que<sb>les testeurs faisaient marche arrière pour se mettre à l'abri et tenter<sb>d'éliminer les soldats à distance.<sb>Les testeurs réussissaient finalement à sécuriser l'espace de combat,<sb>mais se sentaient insatisfaits de la rencontre en raison du côté répétitif<sb>et statique des tactiques employées.<sb>Pour remédier à ce problème, on a eu recours à quelques outils de design<sb>pour décourager ce type de comportement.<sb>Le positionnement du suppresseur du Cartel à l'arrière du camion,<sb>de l'autre côté de la cour, est la clé du design de ce combat.<sb>Le suppresseur ne bouge pas de sa position à l'autre bout de la cour<sb>quand le joueur est de ce côté.<sb>Son positionnement, associé à son tir de suppression constant, force<sb>le joueur à progresser afin de réduire la distance nécessaire pour l'éliminer.<sb>Et pendant ce temps, une combinaison bien choisie d'autres unités du Cartel<sb>lui met une pression intense.<sb>De plus, si le joueur recule assez loin du combat, les soldats du Cartel<sb>les plus mobiles ont pour ordre de battre en retraite et de tenir<sb>leurs positions jusqu'à ce que le joueur revienne dans la zone de combat.<sb>Ces éléments réunis incitent le joueur à avancer vers des endroits<sb>offrant des opportunités plus intéressantes, tant pour le joueur<sb>que pour les soldats ennemis.
Après le combat intense qui la précède, cette tour offre d'abord<sb>un répit avant que l'intensité n'augmente à nouveau dans le combat final<sb>jusqu'aux commandes du rayon tracteur du Cartel.<sb>La partie inférieure de la tour comporte des combats, mais elle a été<sb>conçue pour que le joueur aborde l'espace différemment par rapport<sb>au combat précédent dans la cour.<sb>L'accent est mis ici sur des déplacements verticaux chaotiques<sb>dans la tour, que nous avons trouvés particulièrement réussis en VR<sb>pour les testeurs.<sb>Les robots-lames qui attaquent le joueur au début viennent d'en haut<sb>et s'écrasent sur les tuyaux et les planches, ce qui provoque une pluie<sb>d'étincelles et de débris sur le joueur.<sb>Dans cet environnement déstabilisant, le suppresseur du Cartel qui surgit<sb>en haut de la cage d'escalier permet de réintroduire un degré d'intensité<sb>approprié et de créer un sentiment de lutte acharnée à mesure<sb>que le joueur se rapproche de son objectif.
Au début de la carte précédente, on avait introduit le rayon tracteur,<sb>un dispositif de sécurité utilisé pour stopper la chute de la chambre forte<sb>lorsque la dernière sous-station était neutralisée.<sb>À cet endroit, il semble possible d'utiliser la console pour contrôler<sb>le rayon tracteur et amarrer la chambre forte afin de pouvoir entrer<sb>par la passerelle à gauche.<sb>On a décidé que la chambre forte s'écraserait de façon spectaculaire,<sb>mais pour que ça fonctionne sur le plan émotionnel, il fallait au préalable<sb>que la scène monte en tension.<sb>Le design de la console de contrôle de la chambre forte<sb>est complètement absurde.<sb>Si la console ressemblait trop à un casse-tête conventionnel, les testeurs<sb>prenaient un peu trop de temps pour souffler, sans chercher<sb>à savoir s'ils pouvaient vraiment le résoudre.<sb>Plus la machine semblait complexe, plus ils étaient susceptibles<sb>d'interagir avec les leviers et de rentrer dans le jeu de la catastrophe<sb>inévitable. La première phase du casse-tête déploie la passerelle<sb>et déverrouille la série de leviers que le joueur doit activer<sb>pour trouver la solution.<sb>Chaque levier actionné par la suite ne fait qu'augmenter la tension<sb>tandis que la situation s'aggrave.<sb>Le dialogue radio entre Alyx et Russell accentue lui aussi le sentiment<sb>de panique grandissante de la scène et maintient le joueur focalisé<sb>sur les leviers, qu'il actionne pour tenter de sauver la chambre forte.
Il y a cinq ans, on avait placé des testeurs sous un strider<sb>de <I>Half-Life 2<I> à l'arrêt.<sb>C'était un prototype vraiment simple, mais les retours étaient<sb>extrêmement positifs.<sb>Cette expérience nous a convaincus qu'il fallait intégrer un affrontement<sb>contre un strider en VR.<sb>On a donc conçu des dizaines de prototypes au cours<sb>des années suivantes.<sb>Dans certains designs, les testeurs se retrouvaient très proches du strider.<sb>Dans d'autres versions, un strider les poursuivait dans un environnement<sb>basique ou leur tirait dessus à travers un abri destructible.<sb>Dans d'autres configurations, le strider détruisait un mur derrière lequel<sb>le joueur se cachait, ou faisait quelque chose que le joueur devait observer.<sb>Un prototype conçu en 2017 opposait directement le joueur à un strider<sb>dans une carrière, en combinant plusieurs de nos idées en une seule expérience.<sb>Suite au succès de ce prototype, l'équipe est passée au développement<sb>de l'expérience finale, que vous pouvez voir ici, et qui a nécessité<sb>trois ans de perfectionnement.<sb>À chaque nouvelle version, il y avait un nouvel ensemble de règles,<sb>et de nouvelles attentes de la part du joueur.<sb>Le combat qui suit contre le strider est une suite de rythmes<sb>soigneusement élaborés. Cette scène rassemble des idées qu'on trouvait<sb>amusantes et intéressantes, et a été peaufinée par de nombreux tests.
Les nombreuses itérations de l'affrontement du strider nous permettaient<sb>souvent de résoudre un problème de manière fonctionnelle,<sb>mais on se rendait compte qu'il fallait aussi contextualiser la solution<sb>de manière à ce qu'elle ait un sens.<sb>Par exemple, on a conçu toute cette carte pour intégrer des combats avec<sb>les soldats du Cartel, mais comment fallait-il les placer<sb>dans cet environnement en ruine ? Comment pouvait-on placer un strider endommagé<sb>tout près du joueur ? Que faisait le Cartel ici avant la chute<sb>de la chambre forte ? Ce soldat a été placé ici pour suggérer au joueur<sb>que le Cartel était dans la zone pour enquêter sur une infestation<sb>de fourmis-lions avant que la chambre forte ne tombe.<sb>D'ailleurs, vous pouvez voir quelques cadavres de fourmis-lions dans les parages.<sb>Si vous écoutez attentivement, vous entendrez le soldat qui essaie<sb>de contacter le reste de son escouade, signalant ainsi au joueur qu'il n'est<sb>pas seul et qu'il y aura probablement d'autres combats à venir.
Si la présence de quelques unités du Cartel s'expliquait par l'enquête<sb>sur les fourmis-lions, il fallait trouver un moyen de justifier les escouades<sb>importantes de soldats du Cartel<sb>que le joueur affronte plus tard dans le niveau.<sb>Ces deux unités du Cartel font partie d'une équipe de recherche<sb>des survivants après la chute de la chambre forte, et leur dialogue a pour but<sb>d'informer le joueur que le strider qu'ils ont trouvé<sb>n'est <I>peut-être pas mort<I>.<sb>En fait, c'est le combat contre ces deux soldats qui avertit les troupes<sb>du Cartel de la présence du joueur dans le secteur.
Pour beaucoup de joueurs, les striders sont les ennemis les plus craints<sb>et les plus puissants de la franchise <I>Half-Life<I>, et on a pensé<sb>qu'il serait intéressant de déjouer les attentes des joueurs en les faisant<sb>s'allier à un strider pour coopérer avec lui.<sb>Notre concept initial s'inspirait de la fable <I>Le Lion et la Souris<I> d'Ésope :<sb>le joueur libérait un strider blessé, qui l'aidait plus tard<sb>à s'échapper en lui ouvrant la voie.<sb>Au départ, le parking était un silo du Cartel, et il était beaucoup<sb>plus facile, en termes de crédibilité, d'utiliser une sorte de structure<sb>du Cartel capable de retenir un strider valide.<sb>Lorsque l'endroit s'est transformé en parking effondré, on a immobilisé<sb>le strider en le piégeant dans la cage d'ascenseur,<sb>bloqué par la cabine d'ascenseur.<sb>Une fois libéré, le strider blessé s'en prenait à tout ce qui se trouvait<sb>à proximité, au Cartel comme au joueur, en tentant de s'échapper.<sb>C'était une histoire puissante quand on la racontait, mais il s'est avéré<sb>difficile de l'exprimer d'une manière compréhensible au joueur.<sb>Conserver la proximité du strider tout au long du niveau en jouant<sb>alternativement sur ses états de souffrance et de colère tandis que<sb>le joueur se frayait un chemin dans le parking était déroutant pour<sb>les testeurs, et on a eu beaucoup de mal à trouver le bon équilibre.<sb>Les réactions à cette scène pendant les tests étaient vraiment cohérentes,<sb>c'est pourquoi, même si l'idée nous plaisait, on a opté pour la dynamique<sb>plus directe et réalisable <I>du chasseur et de la proie<I>, qui a finalement été conservée.<sb>L'année passée à travailler sur l'idée <I>du Lion et de la Souris<I> n'a pas été<sb>perdue, cependant, car on a créé et affiné de nombreux éléments narratifs<sb>qui ont été intégrés dans le jeu.<sb>On a également mis au point certaines fonctions et technologies qui ont<sb>contribué au succès de l'expérience finale.
La rencontre avec le strider s'appuie essentiellement sur un ensemble<sb>de fonctions et sur la mitrailleuse du strider, gérée par l'IA.<sb>Maintenir l'illusion que le strider était conscient de la présence<sb>du joueur et qu'il le traquait, tout en gérant l'aspect technique, a nécessité<sb>une coordination délicate entre l'animation et les systèmes d'IA.<sb>On a utilisé diverses approches pour que le strider semble être<sb>une créature intelligente qui traque le joueur.<sb>En VR, le joueur se déplace très lentement comparé aux jeux de tir<sb>à la première personne classiques et on a donc le strider qui alterne entre<sb>des actions de « poursuite », pour suivre le joueur tout au long du niveau,<sb>et des actions de « traque », pour localiser et battre le joueur.<sb>Le déclenchement des différentes étapes de cette finalité a nécessité de nombreux tests.<sb>On a fait particulièrement attention à la façon dont les testeurs<sb>se déplaçaient dans le niveau, puis on a installé les déclencheurs et on a<sb>testé les animations pour les adapter aux comportements les plus courants.<sb>On a vraiment fonctionné sur un échange permanent pour faire évoluer<sb>le rythme et aboutir à une scène capable de convaincre la plupart des joueurs<sb>qu'ils sont traqués par le strider.<sb>Les premiers testeurs en avaient assez de se faire tirer dessus sans temps<sb>mort et sans contraste. On a donc identifié les pauses qui permettaient<sb>de créer ce contraste et on les a insérées aux moments où on voyait les testeurs fatiguer.<sb>Des éléments comme le strider qui défonce le mur, qui passe au-dessus<sb>de vous, ou qui vous poursuit dans une cage d'ascenseur servaient tous<sb>à rythmer l'expérience et à surprendre le joueur.<sb>À chaque fois qu'on voyait ou qu'on nous signalait de l'ennui<sb>ou de la fatigue chez un testeur, on faisait un brainstorming pour savoir<sb>comment insérer ces pauses, puis on les testait pour vérifier<sb>qu'elles étaient bien rythmées.<sb>Un des outils qu'on a utilisés était un système directionnel sophistiqué sur le strider.<sb>Ce système suivait le joueur et orientait de façon procédurale<sb>les différentes parties du strider vers le joueur.<sb>Le corps, la mitrailleuse et le canon magnétique du strider disposaient<sb>tous d'un système spécifique pour segmenter l'animation lorsque le strider perdait ou ciblait le joueur.<sb>Ces systèmes pouvaient être activés ou désactivés de manière<sb>indépendante à des moments précis pour donner l'impression que le strider<sb>s'adressait directement au joueur.<sb>Dans chaque animation de la séquence, le système de la mitrailleuse<sb>et celui du corps étaient activés ou désactivés selon si le strider pouvait voir le joueur ou non.
À ce moment-là, il était important de communiquer clairement au joueur<sb>qu'il était traqué par le strider.<sb>On voulait que le joueur voie le strider se dépoussiérer et se tourner<sb>vers lui afin qu'il sache tout de suite qu'il était devenu la proie.<sb>Ce passage dans l'ascenseur était un outil utile pour y parvenir,<sb>car c'est un des rares moments du jeu où le joueur est « captif ».<sb>La porte de l'ascenseur en face du strider a été conçue dans le but<sb>d'offrir une protection suffisante pour que le joueur se sente<sb>en sécurité, et en même temps une visibilité suffisante pour bien voir le strider.
Au cours du développement, on a beaucoup parlé de l'expérience<sb>de la mitrailleuse du strider qui détruit les murs et le sol du parking pendant<sb>la traque du joueur, mais jusqu'à six mois avant la finalisation,<sb>on n'était pas encore sûrs de pouvoir intégrer un environnement destructible.<sb>On a conçu les abris destructibles pour communiquer visuellement<sb>qu'ils sont en train de céder avant de se détériorer et de voler en éclats.<sb>Au début, l'abri ressemble à un morceau de béton ou à tout autre matériau<sb>de construction banal, mais lorsqu'il est suffisamment endommagé,<sb>il commence à se fissurer visiblement et à générer<sb>des particules de poussière.<sb>Si le même élément subit davantage de dégâts, il se brise en objets<sb>physiques prédécoupés et génère davantage de particules de poussière et de débris.<sb>Lors des tests, on a déterminé la quantité de dégâts qu'un abri<sb>devait encaisser avant de céder et de forcer le joueur à se déplacer.<sb>En fin de compte, le système d'abris destructibles nous a permis d'atteindre<sb>notre objectif, à savoir donner aux joueurs l'impression que le strider était<sb>capable de traverser la structure du parking avec sa mitrailleuse<sb>lorsqu'il les poursuivait.
Dans cette zone de la carte, on commençait à entendre certains testeurs<sb>dire qu'ils trouvaient le tir de la mitrailleuse monotone.<sb>À l'origine, l'arme devait tirer à une cadence déterminée, quel que soit<sb>le comportement du joueur.<sb>Pour remédier à cette monotonie, on a apporté plusieurs améliorations<sb>à l'IA du strider quand il utilise uniquement sa mitrailleuse.<sb>La mitrailleuse tire si elle voit le joueur, mais elle prend un peu<sb>de temps pour acquérir la cible. Elle émet un son qui indique qu'elle a<sb>verrouillé sa cible, puis elle « truffe » le joueur de balles<sb>de sa première rafale.<sb>Les rafales de balles de mitrailleuse sont elles-mêmes saccadées,<sb>et séparées par des intervalles de temps aléatoires.<sb>Si le joueur se met à couvert, le strider continue de tirer pendant<sb>un bref moment là où il a vu le joueur pour la dernière fois.<sb>Ces modifications dans le comportement de la mitrailleuse ont éliminé<sb>la monotonie et donné aux joueurs l'impression qu'ils fuyaient un être vivant.
Pour que la poursuite du strider reste intéressante tout au long<sb>du niveau, on s'est dit qu'il fallait remettre en question les certitudes<sb>du joueur concernant les capacités du strider.<sb>On voulait que la pièce qui suit soit un espace où la plupart des joueurs<sb>pensent savoir à quoi s'attendre, et qu'ils se fassent surprendre<sb>par les capacités du strider.<sb>Pour créer le moment où il défonce l'encadrement de la porte, on a utilisé<sb>l'animation du strider pour réaliser une simulation de destruction<sb>hors ligne qui pouvait être calculée en temps réel par le moteur du jeu.<sb>On y a ajouté des effets de particules et des impulsions physiques<sb>sur des objets physiques interactifs dans la pièce pour que le joueur se sente en danger.<sb>Pour convaincre le joueur que le strider l'avait cherché et trouvé, on a<sb>fait en sorte qu'il marque une courte pause pour regarder le joueur<sb>avant de recommencer à tirer.
En testant l'affrontement contre le strider, on a appris que les joueurs<sb>aimaient se battre contre un ennemi difficile, mais qu'ils n'aimaient pas<sb>subir des dégâts d'une manière qui leur semblait injuste.<sb>Pour remédier à ce problème, on a utilisé l'audio pour indiquer<sb>le comportement du strider.<sb>Par exemple, lorsque le strider n'a pas de visibilité<sb>sur le joueur, il émet un son de recherche à intervalles réguliers.<sb><wait:1.9>Ce son est destiné à indiquer au joueur qu'il est actuellement<sb>en sécurité, mais que le strider est toujours là.<sb>Quand le strider voit le joueur, il passe en mode « poursuite » et émet<sb>les sons de poursuite correspondants.<sb><wait:3.5>Quand le strider est prêt à ouvrir le feu sur le joueur, il émet un son de<sb>« cible acquise » avant de tirer.<sb><wait:2>Les joueurs apprenaient rapidement ces indices sonores<sb>et ne se plaignaient plus de se faire surprendre par le comportement d'attaque du strider.
Il a fallu familiariser le joueur avec la séquence de tir du canon<sb>magnétique du strider afin qu'il puisse la reconnaître quand il y était<sb>de nouveau confronté plus tard sur la carte.<sb>Cette zone particulière de la carte a fait l'objet de nombreuses<sb>modifications pour trouver le moyen de placer de manière fiable le joueur<sb>au bon endroit au bon moment afin qu'il puisse voir un élément clé :<sb>le canon magnétique qui se charge et tire.<sb>Pour y parvenir, on a finalement choisi d'utiliser une porte roulante à deux poignées.<sb>Il fallait que le joueur se trouve à un endroit précis avec<sb>une orientation précise, et que ses mains soient occupées pour qu'on soit sûrs<sb>qu'il ne se téléporte pas ni n'interagisse avec autre chose.<sb>De cette manière, on savait exactement qu'il avait une vue dégagée<sb>et qu'il voyait ce qu'on voulait qu'il voie.
À l'époque où le thème central de cette carte était Le Lion et la Souris,<sb>la rencontre avec le strider prenait fin ici.<sb>Le strider s'en allait tout simplement sur un coucher du soleil.<sb>On voulait que le strider réapparaisse dans un combat ultérieur, peut-être<sb>même lors d'une attaque sur le Cartel aux côtés du joueur, mais cette idée<sb>n'a été retenue que brièvement avant d'être abandonnée.<sb>Le problème était que les testeurs se sentaient floués de ne pas pouvoir<sb>détruire le strider après avoir été traqués et harcelés<sb>pendant si longtemps.<sb>Dans la dernière carte, une fois que le joueur entre dans le labyrinthe<sb>de ruines plus bas, le strider réapparaît et recommence à le traquer.<sb>Étant donné qu'Alyx ne possède pas d'arme capable d'endommager le strider,<sb>on a cherché différentes façons pour le joueur de l'abattre en utilisant<sb>un élément de l'environnement.<sb>On a notamment pensé à déclencher les missiles d'un hélicoptère du Cartel abattu,<sb>à utiliser un de ses mortiers, ou à provoquer un événement physique<sb>qui fauchait les jambes du strider et le tuait.<sb>On a construit de nombreux prototypes pour ces idées, et on a fini<sb>par aboutir à la solution de l'arme d'artillerie montée qui a été conservée.<sb>Elle était simple, reproductible et s'appuyait sur une des mécaniques<sb>les plus simples à assimiler en plein combat.
Dans cette séquence, on voulait que le joueur conclue l'affrontement<sb>en tuant le strider dans un combat de boss épique avec une arme trouvée<sb>dans l'environnement.<sb>Ça signifiait qu'on devait introduire une nouvelle arme plus puissante<sb>que les armes du joueur, qui devait rester dans l'environnement après le combat.<sb>Une arme d'artillerie montée sur un véhicule du Cartel abandonné semblait<sb>assez logique. Après quelques tests initiaux avec un hélicoptère<sb>abattu issu de <I>Half-Life 2<I>, on a opté pour un transport blindé<sb>car on en avait déjà créé un pour une autre section du jeu.<sb>Étant donné que le joueur découvrait ce canon pour la première fois sous<sb>la pression du strider, il devait avoir une mécanique de visée et de tir<sb>très simple à comprendre.<sb>On a mis au point divers prototypes, dont une mitrailleuse à tir<sb>automatique dès que le joueur saisissait sa poignée, ou encore un canon<sb>tirant une bombe collante, que le joueur devait faire exploser après avoir touché la cible.<sb>La mitrailleuse à tir automatique était trop simple à utiliser et manquait<sb>d'effet dramatique. Quant à la bombe collante, l'interaction<sb>supplémentaire requise pour la faire exploser était trop complexe<sb>à enseigner à un joueur sous tension.<sb>On s'est finalement mis d'accord sur un design nécessitant une main<sb>pour viser et l'autre pour recharger et tirer.<sb>Il était nécessaire d'obliger le joueur à pousser le mécanisme de tir<sb>à fond pour recharger afin d'éviter qu'il ne tire trop rapidement.<sb>L'animation de rechargement des munitions est directement contrôlée<sb>par le mouvement du joueur. Elle lui indique qu'il doit avancer sa main<sb>jusqu'au bout pour recharger avant de pouvoir tirer à nouveau.
Quand le joueur pénètre dans la chambre forte et se retrouve immergé<sb>dans une réalité déformée, il perd le contact avec Russell.<sb>Russell n'étant alors plus disponible pour expliquer au joueur<sb>ce qu'il voyait, on a dû illustrer les concepts importants de la chambre forte<sb>en utilisant des effets visuels, physiques et audio, ainsi que de la musique.<sb>Le concept le plus important était que les explosions éparses d'énergie<sb>incontrôlée qui provoquaient des événements d'antiréalité étaient<sb>des débordements de l'énergie vortigaunt. Cette énergie était utilisée<sb>pour maintenir le prisonnier dans la chambre forte, mais l'influence<sb>de ce dernier prenait parfois le dessus via des failles dans l'environnement.<sb>On a utilisé cette composition musicale à partir du crash de la chambre<sb>forte dans la carte précédente pour représenter l'énergie vortigaunt<sb>incontrôlée qui s'échappait de la chambre forte.<sb><wait:5>Et ce morceau<sb><wait:2>pour accompagner les distorsions de réalité provoquées<sb>et influencées par le G-man, de plus en plus proche.<sb>À l'intérieur de la chambre forte, ces motifs sont répétés pour renforcer<sb>la mécanique de l'énergie vortigaunt que le joueur peut finalement<sb>utiliser comme une arme pour affronter le Cartel, libérer le prisonnier,<sb>sauver Eli et terminer le jeu.
Dès qu'on a commencé à écrire l'histoire, l'équipe audio a établi<sb>une charte esthétique adaptée qui incluait des effets, des paysages sonores<sb>et une musique de plus en plus étranges, afin de créer un environnement audio<sb>approprié à la réalité déformée de la chambre forte et à la rencontre<sb>d'Alyx avec le G-man.<sb>Lors du design de la chambre forte, il nous a semblé évident<sb>que la musique d'accompagnement allait être cruciale pour que cet endroit<sb>surréaliste soit convaincant.<sb>La musique de la chambre forte est essentiellement basée sur le palindrome<sb>musical qu'on entend dans la pièce renversée.<sb><wait:48>En utilisant des variations d'éléments de cette composition, et en<sb>les déformant par différents types de tonalité et d'effets, on a pu créer<sb>la sonorité abstraite adéquate.<sb><wait:22>Bien qu'étrange et chaotique, elle était toujours cohérente avec elle-même<sb>et conceptuellement pertinente, étant donné la nature multidimensionnelle<sb>du G-man et de l'énergie vortigaunt qui l'emprisonnait.
<I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> se déroule dans un monde réaliste avec des règles<sb>qui nous sont familières.<sb>La présence du G-man dans la chambre forte nous donnait une justification<sb>scénaristique pour expérimenter différentes distorsions de la réalité<sb>et embrasser le surréalisme dans ces espaces.<sb>Nos premières expériences sur les anomalies de la gravité et la distorsion<sb>de la physique dans l'espace étaient prometteuses, car l'immersivité<sb>de la VR intensifiait leur impact.<sb>Les environnements surréalistes s'avéraient également adaptés<sb>à la résolution des casse-tête, mais ces derniers avaient tendance à ralentir<sb>le rythme au moment où on avait besoin d'une montée en puissance.<sb>Ils n'ont donc pas été retenus dans la version finale.<sb>Le plus intéressant d'entre eux se trouvait dans l'appartement miroir.<sb>À l'origine, le joueur devait repérer et corriger des différences entre<sb>l'appartement du haut et celui du bas pour pouvoir sortir de cette zone.<sb>Au lieu d'intégrer des casse-tête surréalistes, on a fait de la première<sb>moitié de la chambre forte un voyage à travers une série d'environnements<sb>de plus en plus bizarres qui étaient autrefois le bâtiment où le G-man était emprisonné.
Utiliser l'énergie vortigaunt pour surcharger les Russell nous permettait<sb>d'atteindre un objectif : faire en sorte que le joueur désarmé réussisse<sb>à balayer les derniers soldats du Cartel qui gardaient le G-man.<sb>Au départ, on avait intégré des grenades et un couloir en impesanteur.<sb>En parallèle, on expérimentait l'utilisation des Russell pour lancer<sb>des éclairs d'énergie à l'aide des sources d'énergie vortigaunt.<sb>Cette arme s'intégrait naturellement au passage du combat de la chambre<sb>forte parce qu'elle rappelait le concept de charge du pistolet antigravité<sb>à la fin de <I>Half-Life 2<I>, et qu'elle fonctionnait bien avec la mécanique<sb>de lancer des Russell, que le joueur maîtrisait.<sb>Cette nouvelle mécanique était introduite à un moment où le rythme était<sb>capital, et elle devait donc être intuitive et rapide à maîtriser.<sb>En donnant au joueur cette attaque d'énergie, on était cohérents avec<sb>le fait que c'était l'énergie vortigaunt qui contenait le G-man,<sb>et on renforçait aussi l'idée d'une connexion profonde entre Alyx et les Vortigaunts.<sb>Ça permettait également au joueur de se sentir pendant un bref instant<sb>doté de superpouvoirs et capable d'utiliser cette capacité d'une manière<sb>viscérale et profondément physique, ce qui est impossible dans la vraie vie.
Quand le joueur découvre la cage
l'objet de sa longue quête
<sb>et s'en approche, on a voulu intensifier le côté dramatique du moment par une musique<sb>qui devait tout de même rester troublante et cohérente avec le reste<sb>de la chambre forte.<sb>On a continué à utiliser des variations des éléments musicaux précédents,<sb>mais cette fois d'une façon plus claire et légèrement moins abstraite.<sb>Comme dans les compositions précédentes, les cordes tourbillonnantes<sb>sont issues du palindrome musical entendu dans la pièce renversée,<sb>mais les lignes musicales sont disloquées, désynchronisées et juxtaposées<sb>pour représenter les réalités et les temporalités qui s'entrechoquent.<sb><wait:19>Lorsque le joueur s'approche de la cage, un morceau de piano se joint aux<sb>trois lignes de cordes, les liant presque tout en restant à l'écart,<sb>à l'instar du G-man qui lie les différentes intrigues et époques<sb>de la série <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb><wait:40>
Plus les événements de la chambre forte devenaient surréalistes,<sb>plus il était difficile d'imaginer des casse-tête à la fois<sb>abstraits et compréhensibles.<sb>On avait constaté lors de tests qu'à ce stade du jeu, les joueurs<sb>étaient avides d'un regain narratif et que les casse-tête risquaient<sb>de générer de la frustration.<sb>Après quelques expérimentations avec des interactions plus complexes,<sb>on a finalement opté pour une présentation plus théâtrale du moment<sb>où le joueur libère le G-man.<sb>On a réduit le design à une simple interaction du joueur, qui doit saisir<sb>les deux poignées pour envoyer de l'énergie vortigaunt dans le système<sb>afin de détruire la structure qui maintient le G-man emprisonné.<sb>La fin a été réalisée assez tard dans le processus, car tous les éléments<sb>de l'environnement, de l'histoire, du level design, des interactions<sb>et de la musique devaient être en place pour qu'elle soit réussie.<sb>Quoi qu'il en soit, nous sommes satisfaits du résultat et la réaction<sb>des joueurs a été extrêmement positive.
