	"3204206141"	"Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.

	"3996115423"	"Привет, меня зовут Гейб Ньюэлл. Добро пожаловать в игру <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>!<sb>Создать ее было, мягко говоря, непросто:<sb>это наша первая за более чем 10 лет игра из серии<sb><I>Half-Life<I> и первая игровая среда в виртуальной реальности.<sb>Разрабатывая <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>,<sb>мы хотели не просто сделать VR-среду максимально удобной<sb>(сохранив при этом стилистику<cr><I>Half-Life<I>),<sb>но и оправдать ожидания игроков,<sb>которые давно надеялись увидеть продолжение истории Эпизода 2.<sb>В то же время нужно было сделать так,<sb>чтобы те, кто ни разу не играл в<cr><I>Half-Life<I>, могли быстро освоиться.<sb>Удалось нам что-либо из этого или нет, в конечном счете решать вам.<sb>Но я надеюсь,<sb>что режим комментариев позволит вам многое узнать о проблемах,<sb>с которыми мы сталкивались, и нашем подходе к их решению.<sb>Чтобы послушать комментарий, подберите парящие перед вами<sb>голографические наушники и наденьте их.<sb>Дослушав комментарий, снимите наушники или просто наденьте следующие.<sb>Буду рад, если вы поделитесь своими впечатлениями,<sb>написав мне письмо по адресу gaben@valvesoftware.com.<sb>Хоть у меня и нет возможности ответить на каждое письмо,<sb>я читаю их все.<sb>Это крайне важный критерий оценки нашей работы.<sb>Спасибо! И хорошей игры!"
	"1999024229"	"Как и в любой части <I>Half-Life<I>,<sb>первый час игры в <I>Alyx<I><sb>должен донести до игрока значительный объем информации,<sb>желательно в естественной и интересной форме.<sb>Игроку нужно понять, кто этот персонаж, где он находится,<sb>что за мир его окружает,<sb>какие другие важные персонажи и организации в нем есть и так далее.<sb>Вместе с этим надо научиться непосредственно играть в игру.<sb>Как двигаться? С чем и как можно взаимодействовать?<sb>Что нужно делать?<sb>На то, чтобы разобраться, какую именно информацию нам следует<sb>передать на первых двух уровнях и как ее представить,<sb>ушло больше двух лет тестирования.<sb>Конечно, хочется рассказать игроку обо всем,<sb>но у любых сведений есть свой приоритет,<sb>и чем больше мы рассказываем, тем выше вероятность того,<sb>что игрок упустит что-то важное,<sb>сосредоточившись на какой-нибудь мелочи.<sb>Так что на следующих двух уровнях мы отметим комментариями те места,<sb>где донести что-то до игрока оказалось особенно проблематично.<sb>Вы наверняка сможете найти и многие другие примеры,<sb>где заинтересованные и внимательные игроки могли встретить новую информацию."
	"529151720"	"Одним из таких важных моментов, которые было нелегко прояснить для игрока,<sb>было то, когда именно происходят события<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> относительно<sb>других игр серии.<sb>Как мы ни старались оставлять осторожные указания в деталях игрового мира,<sb>тестирование раз за разом показывало, что хронология до конца не ясна.<sb>В конце концов мы сочли эту информацию слишком важной, чтобы оставлять ее<sb>для интерпретации игроков, поэтому поместили в текст в самом начале игры.<sb>Вид недостроенной Цитадели помог нам визуально закрепить восприятие<sb>временного периода как можно раньше.<sb>Действие <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> происходит за пять лет до событий <I>Half-Life 2<I>,<sb>где возвышающаяся Цитадель воплощает средоточие власти Альянса.<sb>Здесь же ранняя инфраструктура Альянса представляет собой запутанный клубок<sb>кабелей и странных построек, разбросанных по всему городу вокруг строящейся<sb>Цитадели, что ясно указывает на временные рамки повествования.<sb>Мы подкрепили это впечатление разными деталями на последующем уровне.<sb>Масштабы и формы архитектуры Альянса, как правило, довольно абстрактны,<sb>поэтому мы добавили знакомые элементы человеческой стройки: большие<sb>внешние леса, какие-то намеки на этажи, ряды осветительных приборов —<sb>и разделили силуэт Цитадели на более четкие вертикальные элементы,<sb>пытаясь найти баланс между ее инопланетной природой и понятными нам<sb>признаками ее размера и текущего состояния.<sb>Большие панорамные виды, подобные этому,<sb>стали для нас интересной задачей в виртуальной реальности.<sb>Поскольку они расположены далеко от наблюдателя, они не так хорошо<sb>охватываются стереоскопическим зрением, как небольшие предметы вблизи.<sb>В результате мелкие вещи на балконе часто притягивают внимание раньше,<sb>чем игрок успевает заметить внушительное здание вдалеке.<sb>Если бы мы придвинули Цитадель поближе, она казалась бы до смешного<sb>громадной, так что рассмотреть ее было бы трудно.<sb>А если поместить ее на линии горизонта, она становится двухмерной, плоской.<sb>Мы нашли решение, заполнив пространство между далеким строением<sb>и наблюдателем другими объектами для масштаба.<sb>Помог сам город с его огромными кабелями, исчезающими в точке схода,<sb>большими однообразными зданиями Альянса, тяжелой завесой выбросов,<sb>освещением и анимированными элементами, особенно вертолетом, шум от которого<sb>начинается еще по мере появления изображения.<sb>Все это было тщательно подобрано, чтобы внимание игрока прежде всего<sb>задержалось на Цитадели, затем перешло на разные детали панорамы города<sb>и только потом остановилось на манящих предметах на балконе."
	"306357606"	"В первых игровых областях мы вечно сталкивались с проблемой плотности<sb>и приоритетности информации, представляемой игроку.<sb>Тестирование показало, что в VR игроки легко отвлекаются,<sb>во многом из-за периферийного зрения,<sb>и сосредотачиваются на одном элементе сцены, теряя из виду остальные.<sb>Это было особенно заметно в первых комнатах,<sb>поскольку игроки привыкали к виртуальной реальности,<sb>которую нередко видели впервые.<sb>К тому же все игроки продвигаются с разной скоростью.<sb>Кто-то, как мы убедились сами, проводит на балконе 30 секунд,<sb>а кто-то — 30 минут.<sb>В итоге мы перебрали множество версий этих вступительных областей,<sb>каждый раз меняя, что и где мы хотим довести до сведения игрока.<sb>Поначалу видеозвонок от Илая проходил подальше,<sb>в укрытии со снарком и камкордером,<sb>но зачастую игроки так увлекались взаимодействием с разными предметами,<sb>что не обращали внимания на разговор Илая с Расселом.<sb>Мы передвинули видеозвонок на начальный балкон,<sb>но там он не давал погрузиться в первую панораму Сити-17 и Цитадели.<sb>Вдобавок на тот момент игроки еще не успевали освоить базовое управление,<sb>а только пробовали двигаться и взаимодействовать с миром руками.<sb>Это усложняло даже простые вещи:<sb> например, когда отображать подсказку по движению,<sb>если игрок сразу запустил видеозвонок?<sb>Со временем мы решили вставить между балконом и укрытием оранжерею,<sb>чтобы звонок проходил в области со слегка ограниченным обзором<sb>и меньшим числом возможных предметов для взаимодействия.<sb>Так игрока ничто не отвлекало и уже не было начальной путаницы<sb>с оборудованием и движением.<sb>Еще одним преимуществом было то,<sb>что так мы смогли добавить новые детали к укрытию Аликс,<sb>не боясь создать помехи для видеозвонка."
	"3249713099"	"Помимо передачи необходимой информации об игровом мире,<sb>первые два уровня<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> также должны были<sb>продемонстрировать сильные стороны VR.<sb>Передать ощущение размера в VR можно куда лучше, чем на плоском экране,<sb>и на раннем этапе тестирования мы поняли,<sb>что ничто не оставляет такого сильного впечатления от размера,<sb>как вид страйдера в двух шагах от себя.<sb>Чтобы в полной мере раскрыть эту сцену,<sb>нужно было проработать не только внешний вид страйдера,<sb>но и его звуковое сопровождение.<sb>Игроки получали четкое представление о массе и силе страйдера,<sb>наблюдая за его движениями, особенно когда тот наступает на балкон,<sb>на котором находится игрок.<sb>Звук должен был соответствовать этим ожиданиям,<sb>для чего мы использовали несколько слоев звуковых эффектов,<sb>контролируя спектр звуковых частот<sb>и временные параметры различных элементов по отдельности.<sb><wait:5>Затем мы объединили эти элементы в звуковом движке Source 2,<sb>чтобы управлять ими как одним звуком."
