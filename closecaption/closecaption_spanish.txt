Unable To Start Game
A game file appears to be missing or corrupted.  In the Steam client go to the game's properties.  In the 'Local Files' tab select 'Verify Integrity of Game Cache' to have Steam double-check the game's installation.
The system ran out of memory while loading the game.
Unable to find a valid Direct 3D device!
Check that your graphics driver is working properly,
and that you satisfy the minspecs of the game you are playing.
Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.
You might be using an old version of fraps which is incompatible with the game. Upgrade to Version 3.5.99 Build 15623 or later.
Error creating a D3D device! This can occur because of incompatibility with some 3rd party applications.
Change Rendering API
The game has detected that changing the rendering API to %s1 should increase your frame rate.
Changing this setting requires restarting the game, though, so approving the change means the game will exit this launch and try to restart after clicking yes.
Do you want the game to switch to the suggested rendering API?
If the game does not start properly after this change you can add -safe_mode to your launch options to override the change.
You can also change the rendering API setting later in the video settings.
Yes
OpenGL Support for Windows DLC required for OpenGL (-gl) mode.
Please download the OpenGL DLC and restart.
Failed to create an OpenGL context.
Your graphics card must support at least OpenGL v%s1.
Required OpenGL extension "%s1" is not supported.  Please update your OpenGL driver.
Vulkan Support DLC required for Vulkan (-vulkan) mode.
Please download the Vulkan DLC and restart.
Vulkan on macOS requires macOS v%s1 or greater.
Failed to initialize Vulkan.
Please make sure your driver and GPU support Vulkan.
To disable Vulkan, remove -vulkan from your launch options.
If you chose Vulkan in the video settings, please add -safe_mode to your launch options to allow the game to start with the default rendersystem.
Required Vulkan extension "%s1" is not supported.  Please update your Vulkan driver.
Not Enough Memory For Game
This device does not meet the minimum requirements.
The game requires at least %s1 of device memory to run reliably,
you may not be able to complete a game on this device.
The device appears to have %s2 of memory.
Unsupported Windows Version
This version of Windows is not supported, please upgrade to a newer version

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Esto no es un truco! ¡Soy Russell! ¡Un amigo de tu padre! ¡De la resistencia!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡No es un truco, Alyx!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! ¿Estás ahí?<cr>Tienes que seguir adelante.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Russell?
<clr:255,190,255>He tenido un accidente.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Ya lo sé! ¡Lo provoqué yo!<sb>Así que, técnicamente, no ha sido un accidente.<cr>Tienes que ponerte en marcha.
<clr:255,190,255>Espera. Espera. ¿Dónde está papá?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Él está bien. Sigue al dron.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Tienes que seguir adelante!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Muévete, Alyx.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, tienes que salir de ahí. Ahora.
<clr:255,190,255>Vale, entendido.
<clr:255,190,255>Así que
papá está <I>bien<I>, ¿verdad?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí. Bueno, no.<cr>Para serte sincero, está en graves problemas.
<clr:255,190,255>Pero...
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Todavía lo tienen.<cr>Iba en un transporte separado.
<clr:255,190,255>
¿Y me salvaste a mí?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, sí.<sb>No tenía forma de saber quién iba en cada furgón.<sb>Así que
Sí.<cr>El resultado fue que te salvé A TI.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Sabemos a dónde lo llevan?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Al centro de detención.<sb>Y luego, cuando se den cuenta de que es Eli Vance
a Nova Prospekt.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pero ya estoy ideando un plan para rescatarlo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Estás cerca de mi laboratorio.<sb>¡Continúa siguiendo al dron!<cr>Ya veremos qué hacer.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, ¡se ha cortado un segundo!<sb>He perdido la señal de vídeo del comunicador.<sb>¿Puedes ver mi dron?<sb>¿Está bien?
<clr:255,190,255>Eh, claro. Sí.<cr>Estoy ahí en un minuto.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell...<cr>¿Qué <I>encontrasteis<I> allí?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Es lo más extraño, no tengo ni idea! Solo
fotos borrosas de un
edificio.
<clr:255,190,255>¿La Ciudadela?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, es algo distinto.<sb>Y sea lo que sea, van a matar a cualquiera que lo haya visto, y a cualquiera que conozca a alguien que lo haya visto.<sb>Eso nos incluye a nosotros
y a tu padre.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Russell?<cr>Aguanta, ya casi estoy ahí.
<clr:255,255,138>Alyx, genial.<cr>Vale, vamos a... espera.<cr>Mi dron está bien, ¿verdad?
<clr:255,190,255>No. Ha explotado.<cr>Yo estoy bien, por cierto.
<clr:255,255,138>Sí. Bien, bueno, eso es el
<cr>Eso es lo más importante
<clr:255,190,255>Russell. Tienen a papá.
<clr:255,255,138>Lo sé. Esto
es un mal asunto.<sb>Van a averiguar lo que sabe y después
<cr>Sí, lo van a matar.
<clr:255,190,255>Oh, Dios
<clr:255,255,138>¡Pero!<sb>La buena noticia es que tenemos algo que ellos no tienen.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Y eso es
<clr:255,255,138>¡Mi plan para rescatarlo!
<clr:255,190,255>Genial. Escuchémoslo.
<clr:255,255,138>Ahora bien.<sb>Se van a dar cuenta rápido de que tu padre no va a hablar.<sb>Y cuando ESO pase, le van a succionar el cerebro.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell.
<clr:255,255,138>Potencialmente.<sb>Tal vez no.<cr>Quiero decir que podría... ellos podrían taladrarle el...
<clr:255,190,255>Basta.
<clr:255,255,138>Ah, sí. Que es tu padre.<sb>Claro.<cr>Bueno, lo que SÍ harán es llevarlo en tren desde AQUÍ
<clr:255,255,138>
Este es Eli
<clr:255,255,138>hasta
Nova Prospekt.
<clr:255,190,255>Y si sube a ese tren
<cr>se acabó, ¿verdad?
<clr:255,255,138>No necesariamente.<cr>Coge algo para que nos represente a nosotros.
<clr:255,255,138>Cualquier cosa sirve.
<clr:255,255,138>Sí. Lo que sea.
<clr:255,255,138>Genial. Ahora ponlo en el mapa.
<clr:255,255,138>Bueno, lo haré yo.
<clr:255,255,138>Vale, esa eres tú.
<clr:255,190,255>Creía que habías dicho «nosotros».
<clr:255,255,138>Bueno, UNO de nosotros... yo... tendrá que quedarse aquí para que este plan funcione.
<clr:255,190,255>Está bien, lo entiendo.
<clr:255,255,138>Justo aquí afuera, hay un segundo tren que también sale de Ciudad 17 y pasa por la zona de cuarentena.
<clr:255,190,255>Vale.
<clr:255,255,138>Ambos trenes coinciden aquí, en el cruce ferroviario de Fairview.<sb>Tú coges tu tren, llegas allí antes que el suyo y hackeas los controles.<sb>Eso me permitirá hacerme con el sistema.
<clr:255,255,138>El tren se detiene.<sb>Te encargas de los miembros de la Alianza.<sb>Y rescatamos a tu padre.
<clr:255,190,255>Me parece bien.<cr>¿Dónde está el tren que voy a coger?
<clr:255,255,138>Ahí detrás, pasando el patio.<sb>No está en servicio, pero creo que podré hackear los controles.
<clr:255,255,138>Oh, y coge un par de Russells al salir.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Russells?
<clr:255,255,138>Los guantes, Alyx.<sb>Ya sabes, los guantes de gravedad.<sb>Tengo unos cuantos pares por ahí.<sb>Puedes calibrarlos junto al cobertizo.
<clr:255,190,255>Entendido.
<clr:255,255,138>Podemos conseguirlo, Alyx.<sb>¿Has oído?<sb>¿Dije que lo vamos a conseguir?<sb>Porque lo vamos a lograr.
<clr:255,190,255>Sí, lo lograremos.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Estaré contigo en cada paso que des.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Muy bien, ya sabes cómo va esto.<sb>Debería haber un montón de trastos ahí abajo.<sb>Apunta hacia algo con la mano abierta.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Solo apunta tu mano a algo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Los guantes no se van a calibrar solos.<sb>Aunque supongo que probablemente deberían.<sb>Esa es una de las cosas de los guantes que no he
arreglado.
<clr:255,190,255>Listo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora cierra tu mano y muévela hacia ti.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Solo mueve la muñeca.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿La estás moviendo? No puedo ver si la estás moviendo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cierra y mueve.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cierra
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>
y mueve.
<clr:255,190,255>Um. No ha funcionado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien, el sensor de referencia no está correctamente ajustado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Inténtalo de nuevo.<sb>Elige un objetivo, apúntale, con la mano abierta.
<clr:255,190,255>Aún no funciona.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Umm.
<clr:255,190,255>Ah, ah.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Inténtalo de nuevo.
<clr:255,190,255>No.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Una vez más.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Elige un objetivo, apunta a él, y abre la mano.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Excelente! Ahora cierra el puño.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien, ahora cierra el puño.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Qué te parece?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Fijado.<sb>Ahora mueve la muñeca hacia ti para atraerlo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Casi.<sb>Inténtalo de nuevo, pero esta vez cógelo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Muévela de nuevo e intenta atraparlo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Eso es.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Lo lograste.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bum, sí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Lo tienes.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Orientados.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Estás conectada.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, tienes conexión.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cierra tu mano.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora ciérrala.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Agarra.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora cierra tu mano.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Genial.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Justo así.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Perfecto.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Otra vez, pero atrápalo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pero agárralo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora agárralo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Intenta agarrarlo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Agárralo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, imagina que hay algo como un gatillo en los Russells.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora apunta con tu mano
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Aprieta el gatillo
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y ahí lo tienes.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, debería de haber un pequeño gatillo cerca del dedo índice en cada uno de tus Russells.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Perfecto, ya está.<sb>¡Oh! Espera, casi lo olvido.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! ¡Aquí arriba!
<clr:255,255,138>¡Vas a necesitar un arma!
<clr:255,255,138>¡No te preocupes, está descargada!
<clr:255,255,138>¡Ahora está descargada!
<clr:255,255,138>¿Has visto dónde ha ido?
<clr:255,255,138>Creo que está sobre el capó de ese coche, ahí.
<clr:255,255,138>Oh. Casi se me olvida, las pistolas necesitan munición.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Ahí va!
<clr:255,255,138>Debería estar por ahí en el suelo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Creo que ha caído sobre el capó de ese coche.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Perfecto! Vuelvo a la sala de comunicaciones.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Russell? Me he quedado sin munición.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Aquí tienes!
<clr:255,190,255>¿Oye, Russell? Yo, eh
me he quedado sin munición de nuevo.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Ten cuidado!
<clr:255,190,255>¿Russell? Me he quedado sin munición. Otra vez.
<clr:255,255,138>No te preocupes, aquí tengo más munición.
<clr:255,255,138>Pero deja que te recuerde que
aquí los suministros son limitados. ¿Vale? Solo... te aviso por anticipado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Oye, ten cuidado! ¡Esa es mi ventana!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ah, te encargaste del candado.<sb>Bien. Genial.<sb>Yo tenía la llave.<sb>Pero tendría que habértela dado
<sb>es culpa mía.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ese es el tren, Alyx.<sb>Intenta abrir la puerta.<sb>Ya casi he conseguido que el tren esté en línea aquí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Hay alguna manera de hackear la puerta del tren?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Mira a ver si puedes abrir la puerta.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Muy bien! Allá vamos.<sb>Próxima parada: cruce ferroviario de Fairview.
<clr:255,190,255>Gracias, Russell.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y buena suerte, Alyx.<sb>Adiós.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Obviamente, solo para que lo sepas, sigo aquí.
<clr:255,190,255>Lo sé.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Hola, ¿Alyx? PUEDE que tengamos un problema.<cr>Seguramente nada de lo que preocuparse, pero
<clr:255,190,255>Guau.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Ha parado el tren?<cr>Se ha detenido, ¿verdad?
<clr:255,190,255>Sí, ¿qué ha pasado?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Arg, está bloqueado.<cr>Cuando la Alianza cerró la zona de cuarentena, debieron de aumentar la seguridad.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Qué quieres decir?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pues... sí. Ni siquiera estás cerca del cruce ferroviario de Fairview.<cr>Estás justo fuera de la zona de cuarentena.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y hasta AQUÍ
es lo más lejos que vamos a llegar en tren.
<clr:255,190,255>Estoy yendo a pie.
<clr:255,190,255>Entonces me voy andando.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien. Veré si puedo encontrarte otra manera de entrar.
<clr:255,190,255>Aquí hay un zombi muerto.<sb>¿Pensaba que la Alianza había sellado la zona de cuarentena?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ah, este se ha debido de escapar.<sb>Escuché que tenían problemas con esporas de lapa fuera del área de contención.<sb>Pero no con tipos como este.
<clr:255,190,255>Probablemente no sea un caso aislado, entonces.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Lo dudo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahh
Mira eso. Resina.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y si hay resina por aquí, también debería haber un fabricador de la Alianza.<sb>Estate atenta, quizá podamos mejorar un poco tu potencia de fuego.
al final me voy a quedar sin munición.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, estate atenta.<sb>No escasean los muertos por aquí y
bueno, hablando sin rodeos, ellos ya no necesitan la munición.
<clr:255,190,255>Um, creo que puedo redirigir esto con mi multiherramienta.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Tu qué?
<clr:255,190,255>Es una herramienta con diferentes funciones.<sb>Así que, ya sabes... multiherramienta.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx, ¡esa cosa es increíble!<sb>¡Necesitas un nombre igual de increíble!<sb>¡Algo que venda de verdad!
<clr:255,190,255>¿A quién se la voy a vender?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, la Alianza no estará aquí eternamente.<sb>¡Alyx, deberías pensar en el futuro!
<clr:255,190,255>Bueno, ¿qué te parece si la llamo «la Alyx»?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Umm. Se parece un poco a «los Russells», pero sí...<sb>Provisionalmente, vale, «la Alyx».
<clr:255,190,255>Sí, «la Alyx».
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Bien hecho!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Mira, una estación de salud!
<clr:255,190,255>Russell, la <I>Alianza<I> las usa.<sb>¿Crees que sean seguras?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Gracias a Dios, una estación de salud.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Claro, yo las uso todo el tiempo.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Estás seguro?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Así es, son geniales.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Solo mete tu mano ahí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Mira, francamente, solo tira de la palanca y mete tu mano ahí.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Claro, yo las uso todo el tiempo. Solo encuentra una pila de energía.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Muy bien amiga mía, estás lista.
<clr:255,190,255>¡Ay! Ay, ay, ay.
<clr:255,190,255>Ahhhh. Ey
<clr:255,190,255>Ahhh. Ooh.
<clr:255,190,255>Oye
tenías razón. <cr>Son geniales.
<clr:255,190,255>Ahhh. Qué alivio.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oye, cuidado con esa lapa, Alyx.
<clr:255,190,255>Son asquerosas.
<clr:255,190,255>Entonces, ¿cuándo comenzaste a llamar a los guantes de gravedad «los Russells»?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ese es el nombre de la marca, Alyx.
<clr:255,190,255>¿El nombre de la marca?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, necesitan un nombre que sea reconocible. Voy a hacer una fortuna con estas cosas después de que la Alianza se vaya y todo en la tierra vuelva a la normalidad.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Cómo conociste a mi padre?<sb>Trabajasteis juntos en Black Mesa, ¿verdad?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí. Bueno, no.<sb>En realidad, era difícil conseguir un trabajo allí.<sb>Hice una entrevista para Black Mesa.<sb>Me dijeron que lo intentara de nuevo pasado un año.<sb>No hace falta que te diga lo que ocurrió después.<sb>Tuve suerte, la verdad.<sb>No hubo muchos supervivientes.<sb>Sinceramente, es un milagro que tu padre y tú salierais de allí con vida.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh. Um... ¿Necesitas un minuto?<sb>Porque vas a... Digo, puedo apagar la cámara...
<clr:255,190,255>Solo estoy mirando, Russ.
<clr:255,190,255>Supongo que la zona de cuarentena está detrás de esta puerta acorazada.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, sí, ahí es donde la tienen.
<clr:255,190,255>Buscaré un panel de control para abrirla.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Si yo fuera parte de la Alianza, ¿dónde pondría el panel de control?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ese es el panel de control.<sb>Probablemente hayan desarmado el circuito.<sb>Pero teniendo en cuenta que nadie sería tan estúpido como para abrir la puerta acorazada, no debería ser muy difícil de reparar.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Qué crees que es esto?
<clr:255,190,255>Creo que
es una especie de cerradura.
<clr:255,190,255>Guau, eso es.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Ja, ja! Ahí está. Por fin.
<clr:255,190,255>Voy a entrar.<cr>¿A qué distancia está el cruce ferroviario de Fairview?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tendrás que pasar por los viejos túneles del subterráneo para llegar al almacén ferroviario.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Han empezado ya a trasladar a papá?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No lo creo.<sb>Lo cual son buenas noticias, porque todavía tenemos tiempo.
<clr:255,190,255>Oh, eso es genial.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>O malas noticias, porque ya lo han matado.<sb>Y no necesitas trasladar un cadáver.<sb>Solo lo entierras.<sb>O lo quemas.<sb>¿Sigues ahí, Alyx?
<clr:255,190,255>Uum, ehh.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Sabes, Russell? Ahora que voy a entrar en la zona de cuarentena
Me acabo de dar cuenta.<sb>No sé nada <I>sobre<I> la zona de cuarentena.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, en realidad, la palabra cuarentena viene del italiano «quaranta giorni».<sb>Eh, que significa cuarenta días: el periodo que todos los barcos debían permanecer en aislamiento antes de que la tripulación pudiera bajar a tierra durante la peste negra.
<clr:255,190,255>Vaaale. Genial.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh, rayos.
<clr:255,190,255>Creo que nos quedamos encerrados aquí.
<clr:255,190,255>Oye, Russell.<sb>Acabo de encontrar una jeringuilla de Dios sabe qué.<sb>¿Sabes si es medicina?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Tiene una calavera y huesos cruzados?
<clr:255,190,255>No, no tiene nada de eso.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Entonces probablemente es medicina.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! ¡¿Acabas de inyectarte algo que has encontrado en el suelo?!
<clr:255,190,255>Me siento GENIAL.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Sí? Bien. Muy bien, Pues
Experimento exitoso. Mantén los ojos abiertos por si encuentras más.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Has oído eso?
<clr:255,190,255>¿El qué?
<clr:255,190,255>Santo cielo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí. Por ahí
por ahí hay que ir.
<clr:255,190,255>¿No hay un atajo?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Así es, ese es el atajo.
<clr:255,190,255>Bueno, tomemos el camino largo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, también es la ruta más larga.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bien, eso parece que ha funcionado. Sigamos haciéndolo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138><sfx:1>[risas]
<clr:255,190,255>Ah, vaya.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Ja, ja!<cr>Esa lapa está de nuestro lado.<sb>Bueno, en realidad no, así que no pases por debajo de ella.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Sabes?... Los Russells tienen una pantalla integrada. Te muestran cuánta resina y munición tienes. Ya sabes, puede resultar útil.
<clr:255,190,255>De acuerdo. Gracias.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, pero ten cuidado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! ¡Detrás de la puerta!<sb>¡Creo que hay un fabricador de la Alianza!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! Creo que eso es un fabricador de la Alianza.<sb>Pon algo adentro, quiero ver cómo funciona.
<clr:255,190,255>Entendido. ¿Funcionará con los Russells?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, pero debería hacerle un buen apaño a esa pistola.<cr>Menos mal que te di una de mis peores armas.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, ya sabes... en caso de que no la vuelva a ver.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Sabes qué te digo, Russell?<cr>Si muero, te debo una pistola.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡De todos modos me debes un arma!<cr>Ese no fue un regalo. Es MI arma.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, ha valido la pena usar la resina.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>La Alianza sabe cómo mejorar un arma.<sb>Tengo que admitirlo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Parece muy letal.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Genial.<sb>Casi desearía estar ahí para probarla yo mismo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Puedes darle un buen uso.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y ahora
eso te va a ayudar.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Excelente elección.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Inteligente. Va a resultar muy apañado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Debería ayudar a prevalecer en algunas discusiones.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No me gustaría estar en el lado equivocado de eso.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ahora que se ha actualizado.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ya no puede hacerse más mortífera.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh, eso parece que ha funcionado de verdad, ¿no es cierto? Ah
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Guau! ¡Mi pistola tiene buena pinta!
<clr:255,190,255>Vamos, Russ. A este punto, ya es «nuestra» arma.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Oh, guau, mira eso! Mi pistola mejora cada vez más.
<clr:255,190,255>Sabes, Russ... ¿Técnicamente? Es muy poco lo que QUEDA de tu pistola.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Umm. Pues, te diré algo. Vamos a dejar eso para otro momento. Podemos hablar sobre mi pistola cuando regreses.
<clr:255,190,255>Bueno, Russ, es oficial. Ya no queda NADA tuyo en esta pistola. Esta es
MI pistola.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Muy bien, me parece justo. Te la has ganado. Pero aún quiero que me devuelvas los Russells.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Cangrejo!
<clr:255,190,255>¡Ya veo!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Espera. ¿Dónde se ha metido?
<clr:255,190,255>¡Ah!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Ah!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí. Ahí está. Lo encontraste.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Probablemente solo era uno.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Vale, dos. Eran dos.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Buena puntería, Alyx.
<clr:255,190,255>Gracias. Gracias, Russell.
<clr:255,190,255>Gracias. ¿Sabes? A pesar de toda tu charla sobre lo «peor» que es esta arma, resulta que no está tan mal.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí
en realidad es bastante buena, ¿verdad?<cr>¡Rayos! Creo que te di el arma equivocada.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Has oído algo sobre papá, Russell?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No. Solo silencio en la radio desde que lo subieron al tren.
<clr:255,190,255>Maldición.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>La buena noticia es que probablemente esté bien.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Cómo lo sabes?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Porque lo están llevando a Nova Prospekt para torturarlo.<sb>Ahí es donde torturan.<sb>Así que apenas lo van a torturar antes de LLEGAR allí.<sb>Así que está bien... lógicamente hablando.
<clr:255,255,138>¡Ah!

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Umm. No está funcionando.
<clr:255,190,255>Ahh. Mira, aquí. Necesita electricidad.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Eso es un «disquete».<cr>Lo usábamos para guardar información. Funciona con magnetismo, si puedes creerlo.
<clr:255,190,255>Ja.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Para ser específicos, dos micrómetros de óxido de hierro magnetizado, tres micrómetros de ferrita de bario y uno coma dos...
<clr:255,190,255>Russell. ¿Cómo sabes todo esto?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Lo estoy leyendo aquí en mi ordenador.<cr>Me descargué Internet antes de la guerra.
<clr:255,190,255>Te descargaste todo Internet.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Eh, casi todo.
<clr:255,190,255>Estupendo.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Sí, así es.
<clr:255,190,255>Russell, ¿estás viendo esto?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ah, posiblemente.<sb>¿Estás viendo basura flotante?
<clr:255,190,255>Parece que solo es
cartón.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Cierto. Al menos parece inofensivo.
<clr:255,190,255>Sí, pero no deja de ser raro.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Qué ES eso?
<clr:255,190,255>Parecen dibujos de vortigaunts
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Espera, eso es
¿Black Mesa?
<clr:255,190,255>Alguien invirtió mucho tiempo en esto.

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Alyx! ¿Estás bien? ¿Qué pasa?

<clr:255,190,255>De acuerdo, Russ. REALMENTE necesito que vuelvas a hablar.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Por supuesto. Sé específica.

<clr:255,190,255>Um, no. No tengo ni idea.

Añades tomates y lechuga, no esa pasta vegetal, frescos.<sb>Luego añades beicon, que es de un animal que solíamos llamar «cerdo».<sb>Tuestas el pan y pones todo eso dentro de él.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Y os comíais todo eso? ¡Es una locura!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¡Lo es! Y no he terminado.<sb>Después añades otro sándwich encima del primero.<sb>Le pones jamón
también del cerdo
y pavo, de un animal al que solíamos llamar «pavo», y más tomate, más lechuga, y un montón de cosas que se me olvidan.<sb>Medía 15 centímetros de alto, pesaba casi medio kilo y tenía una docena de ingredientes de cinco continentes distintos.<sb>Era el alimento más imposible que te pudieras imaginar en cualquier época anterior a la nuestra.

Guau.

<clr:255,190,255>¿Seis? Eso no es gran cosa.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Así es la vida, Alyx.<cr>Ya sabes, no siempre es gran cosa.
<clr:255,190,255>Bueno, tal vez si sacamos a la Alianza de la Tierra podríamos llegar a un ocho, ¿sabes?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ooh, un ocho.<cr>Sí, eso estaría muy bien.<sb>Muy bien.
<clr:255,190,255>Entonces, cuando expulsemos a la Alianza de la Tierra, ¿qué vas a hacer?

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>¿Trabajo? Alyx, tu inventaste «la Alyx».<cr>¡Por supuesto que te puedo dar trabajo!
<clr:255,190,255>Podríamos hacernos socios.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ooh, bueno, ah
<sb>Um. Bueno, habría opciones de compra de acciones.<sb>Período de adquisición de cinco a diez años, obviamente.<sb>Podría ser muy lucrativo para ti, Alyx.<sb>A largo plazo.

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Tanta presión, de hecho, que yo
<sb>Bueno, dudo incluso en mencionarlo.<sb>Pero me di cuenta de que cuando alcanzabas la mano de tu padre, si él la hubiera agarrado, habría aplastado los delicados sensores de los Russells.
<clr:255,190,255>Oh. Bueno.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Totalmente comprensible... y habría valido la pena, por cierto... en este caso.

<clr:255,190,255>Oh, papá dijo que robó algunos archivos sobre esta arma.

<clr:255,190,255>¿No eres tú el experto?...

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Y así se desplomará la bóveda.<sb>Simple. Fácil de seguir.<sb>Me gusta este plan.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Bueno, tú... por una buena razón, estoy seguro... rechazaste mirar por la ventana.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Así que olvídate de la ventana. Del otro lado estaba la bóveda que tu padre quería que encontráramos.<sb>Está flotando en el aire, lo cual nos complica llegar a ella.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Pero... está llena de cables.<sb>Supongo que si seguimos los cables y destruimos aquello a lo que están conectados, deberíamos poder inutilizar la bóveda.

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, no lo creo.
<clr:255,190,255>Entonces cuenta conmigo.
<clr:255,190,255>¿Has oído alguna comunicación por radio de la Alianza sobre papá escapándose?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, nada. Todo es sobre un envío de refuerzos a la zona de cuarentena.
<clr:255,190,255>En el lado positivo, eso quiere decir que papá va en camino hacia ti.<sb>Tendríamos que haber oído algo si hubieran capturado de nuevo a Eli Vance.

<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ohhh. Sí, eso tiene mucho más sentido.

Hola, soy Gabe Newell y quiero darte la bienvenida a <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Me quedaría corto si dijera que<cr>este juego ha sido un desafío:<sb>es el primer título de <I>Half-Life<I> que sacamos<cr>en más de una década,<cr>además de ser<sb>el primero en realidad virtual.<sb>Aparte de ofrecer una experiencia<cr>en realidad virtual fantástica sin<sb>perder la esencia de un <I>Half-Life<I>, queríamos que <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> satisficiera a todos los jugadores<sb>que querían saber qué sucedía<cr>después del Episodio 2 y,<sb>al mismo tiempo, que fuera una introducción<cr>para quienes no hayan jugado jamás<sb>a un <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>En tu mano queda decidir<cr>si hemos logrado nuestro propósito,<sb>y esperamos que este modo comentario te proporcione algún tipo de información<sb>sobre los problemas<cr>a los que nos hemos enfrentado<cr>y cómo los hemos resuelto.<sb>Para escuchar un nodo de comentario,<cr>coge el holograma flotante<sb>del comunicador de radio que tienes enfrente<cr>y póntelo en la cabeza.<sb>Cuando termines de escuchar el comentario,<sb>puedes quitarte el comunicador de radio<cr>o ponerte el siguiente.<sb>Estoy deseando conocer tu opinión.<sb>Puedes ponerte en contacto conmigo a través de la dirección gaben@valvesoftware.com.<sb>Aunque no puedo responder a todos los correos<cr>que recibo, te garantizo que los leo todos,<sb>puesto que estas opiniones<cr>son una herramienta fundamental para evaluar nuestro trabajo.<cr>Gracias ¡y que te diviertas!
Al igual que otros juegos de <I>Half-Life<I>, la primera hora de <I>Alyx<I> debe transmitir<sb>mucha información al jugador, idealmente<cr>de forma espontánea y entretenida.<sb>El jugador debe saber quién es, dónde está,<cr>en qué tipo de mundo<sb>se encuentra, quiénes son los demás personajes<cr>y facciones importantes, etcétera.<sb>Además, debe aprender cómo se juega.<sb>¿Cómo tiene que moverse? ¿Con qué elementos puede interactuar y de qué manera?<sb>¿Cuál es su objetivo? Estas son algunas de las preguntas principales.<sb>Nos pasamos más de dos años realizando pruebas para averiguar exactamente<sb>qué información debíamos incluir<cr>en los primeros dos niveles,<sb>además de cómo transmitirla.<sb>Es muy tentador incluir todo lo que pensamos que un jugador debería saber,<sb>pero la información debe priorizarse;<cr>cuanta más incluyamos,<sb>más probable será que al jugador<cr>se le escape algo importante<sb>porque algo menos relevante lo ha distraído o confundido. En los próximos dos niveles, recurriremos a nodos<cr>de comentarios para indicar algunos<sb>de los lugares específicos donde hemos abordado el problema de transmitir información al jugador.<sb>Entre nodo y nodo, seguramente<cr>verás muchos otros ejemplos que<sb>podrán encontrar los jugadores interesados<sb>en prestar más atención y conocer mejor<cr>el mundo que los rodea.
Uno de los datos importantes que nos costó incorporar fue la línea temporal;<sb>trazar con exactitud cuándo sucede<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> dentro de la saga.<sb>Aunque nuestra intención ha sido reflejarlo mediante detalles dispersados por el mundo,<sb>durante las pruebas nunca llegó<cr>a ser un éxito rotundo.<sb>Al final, decidimos que era demasiado importante como para que los jugadores<sb>tuvieran que averiguarlo por su cuenta, así que lo incluimos en el texto de introducción.<sb>La Ciudadela aparece incompleta, lo que nos dio<sb>la oportunidad de reforzar<cr>visualmente la línea temporal.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> tiene lugar cinco años antes<cr>de los eventos de <I>Half-Life 2<I>,<sb>cuando la imponente Ciudadela representa<cr>la sede del poder de la Alianza.<sb>Sin embargo, como vemos aquí, la infraestructura inicial de la Alianza es<sb>un amasijo de cables y peculiares edificios diseminados por la ciudad<sb>alrededor de la construcción de la Ciudadela.<cr>Esto resultó de gran utilidad<cr>para establecer la línea temporal.<sb>Quisimos reforzar esta impresión en otros lugares durante el siguiente nivel.<sb>La arquitectura de la Alianza suele ser abstracta en cuanto a escala y forma, por lo que<sb>hemos incluido construcciones que se asemejan a las humanas y que resultarán familiares<cr>a los jugadores:<sb>los enormes andamios externos, distinciones<cr>en los niveles inferiores,<sb>hileras de pequeñas luces y la organización <cr>de la silueta para ofrecer<sb>elementos verticales mejor estructurados y<cr>un equilibrio a la hora de capturar<sb>la naturaleza extraterrestre de la Ciudadela al mismo tiempo que su construcción<sb>resulta lo suficientemente familiar para comprender mejor su tamaño y condición.<sb>Las amplias vistas panorámicas, como esta, supusieron un reto de lo más interesante<cr>en realidad virtual.<sb>Al encontrarse tan lejos del jugador, no aprovechan la visión estereoscópica,<sb>a diferencia de los objetos pequeños más cercanos.<sb>Debido a esto, los pequeños objetos de un balcón suelen llamar la atención<sb>de los jugadores antes que la imponente estructura que se ve a lo lejos.<sb>Si hubiéramos acercado demasiado la Ciudadela, se habría visto tan grande que habría sido difícil apreciarla como es debido.<sb>Sin embargo, colocada por sí sola en el horizonte, parecía bidimensional y plana.<sb>Nuestra solución fue llenar el espacio<cr>entre el jugador y esa estructura lejana<sb>con muchas referencias con las que<cr>comparar sus dimensiones.<sb>La ciudad, el enorme tendido eléctrico que conduce al punto de convergencia,<sb>los grandes edificios que se repiten, la niebla causada por la extrema polución,<cr>una iluminación cuidadosa<sb>y los elementos animados; en especial, el helicóptero, cuyo sonido se va oyendo<cr>cada vez más.<sb>Todos estos elementos se han dispuesto meticulosamente para atraer la atención del jugador<sb>a la Ciudadela al principio para luego desviarla<sb>hacia los detalles de la ciudad y que termine fijándose en los tentadores objetos del balcón.
En estas primeras zonas del juego, tuvimos dificultades para establecer la densidad<sb>y la prioridad de la información<cr>que se transmite al jugador.<sb>Las pruebas revelaron que los jugadores en realidad virtual se distraían con facilidad,<sb>principalmente a causa de la mejor visión periférica que poseen. Por ejemplo, se centraban<sb>en un elemento del escenario e ignoraban el resto.<sb>Esto era mucho más palpable en las primeras salas, ya que los jugadores estaban<sb>acostumbrándose al modo de realidad virtual.<cr>En muchas ocasiones, era la primera vez<cr>que lo utilizaban.<sb>Además, no todos los jugadores<cr>avanzan al mismo ritmo.<sb>Algunos pasaban 30 segundos en el balcón inicial<cr>y otros, 30 minutos.<sb>Como resultado, realizamos varias repeticiones<cr>en este conjunto de zonas iniciales,<sb>y en cada una de ellas modificábamos la información que queríamos transmitir y su ubicación.<sb>Al principio, la videollamada de Eli tenía lugar <cr>en la sala de refugio posterior<sb>con el snark y la cámara,<cr>pero los jugadores se distraían tanto<sb>interactuando con todos los detalles que no prestaban atención a la conversación<cr>entre Eli y Russell.<sb>Decidimos desplazar<cr>la videollamada al balcón inicial,<sb>pero eso hacía que los jugadores se distrajeran del plano de establecimiento de Ciudad 17<cr>y la Ciudadela.<sb>Además, aparecía en un momento en el que<cr>los jugadores seguían aprendiendo<cr>mecánicas fundamentales,<sb>como moverse o interactuar con<cr>el mundo usando las manos.<sb>Este conflicto complicó elementos más sencillos, como cuándo mostrarle al jugador<sb>información de movimiento si comenzaban<cr>la videollamada de inmediato.<sb>Finalmente, optamos por insertar el invernadero entre el balcón inicial<sb>y el refugio. Esto nos permitió pasar<cr>la llamada a una zona<sb>con un panorama menos claro y con menos objetos con los que interactuar.<sb>Así, evitamos los problemas de distracción y nos aseguramos de que los jugadores habían pasado<sb>los momentos de juego iniciales, cuando tienen que aprender a usar el equipo<cr>y el control de movimiento.<sb>Además, nos permitió añadir<cr>más detalles al balcón inicial<sb>y al refugio de Alyx sin temor a crear distracciones de la videollamada.
Además de transmitir información crucial sobre<cr>la situación de este mundo,<sb>los primeros dos niveles de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> también debían mostrar algunos de los puntos fuertes<cr>de la realidad virtual.<sb>La percepción de magnitudes es algo más fácil de transmitir en realidad virtual que<cr>con una pantalla plana,<sb>y las pruebas iniciales nos demostraron que nada lo lograba mejor que ver de cerca a un zancudo.<sb>Además de la parte gráfica, para transmitir totalmente las dimensiones de un zancudo<sb>a corta distancia, tuvimos que trabajar mucho<cr>en la parte acústica.<sb>Los jugadores tenían grandes expectativas sobre<cr>el peso, el poder y la presencia<sb>que el zancudo podría transmitir con sus movimientos; especialmente al pasar<cr>por el balcón donde se encuentra el jugador.<sb>Para transmitir esta sensación acústicamente, colocamos varios efectos de sonido por capas<sb>para poder abordar la gama de frecuencias del espectro audible y la naturaleza temporal<cr>de estos elementos por separado.<sb><wait:5>A continuación, combinamos estos elementos en el motor acústico Source 2 para controlarlos<cr>como si fueran un único sonido.
Esta sala, conocida por el equipo como<cr>el refugio de Alyx, inicialmente<sb>era el lugar donde tenía lugar la videollamada de Eli.<sb>Sin embargo, cuando pasamos<cr>dicha videollamada al balcón,<sb>esta sala quedó libre y la empleamos<cr>para resolver otros problemas.<sb>En la saga <I>Half-Life<I>, siempre hemos querido asegurarnos de que<sb>la parte narrativa era lo suficientemente exhaustiva como para que todos los jugadores<cr>sepan hacia dónde<sb>se dirigen y por qué, al tiempo que quienes<cr>se detienen a observarlo todo<sb>puedan descubrir más detalles que ayudan<cr>a entenderlo mejor todo.<sb>El balcón es un lugar donde familiarizarse<cr>con el juego;<sb>el invernadero, la parte donde arranca la historia;<cr>y el zancudo sorprende a los jugadores,<sb> así que decidimos que el refugio sería<sb>un remanso de paz para ellos.<cr>Allí, podrían descubrir más detalles<sb>de la historia en el entorno.<sb>Además, sería un lugar donde poder juguetear<sb>un poco más tras haberse acostumbrado<cr>a la realidad virtual.<sb>El tiempo que se pasa en el refugio sirve para que los jugadores conozcan el papel de Alyx<sb>en la resistencia y su lugar en este mundo.<sb>Queríamos dar la impresión de que era un auténtico lugar de vigilancia, donde Alyx<cr>habría pasado semanas<sb>o meses planeando el asalto<cr>e investigando la Alianza.<sb>La cámara, el snark y las pizarras son artículos que responden a la interacción<sb>detallada. Además, recompensan la investigación más exhaustiva y ofrecen<sb>a los jugadores más curiosos información adicional sobre el mundo de Ciudad 17<cr>y qué ha estado haciendo Alyx.
Dos elementos fundamentales que queríamos que comprendieran los jugadores fueron<sb>fáciles de formular, pero no de transmitir:<cr>que juegan como<sb>Alyx Vance, no el Gordon Freeman<cr>de los <I>Half-Life<I> anteriores,<sb>y que ella, a diferencia de Gordon,<cr>sí que iba a hablar.<sb>Puede que ahora parezca obvio, pero no lo fue<cr>para los jugadores de pruebas<sb>hasta que no nos centramos en ello.<sb>Queríamos asegurarnos de que todo el mundo era consciente de que jugaría como Alyx,<sb>por lo que decidimos hacerlo tan obvio como fuera posible; por eso su nombre<cr>aparece en el título del juego.<sb>Incluso después de eso, tuvimos mucho cuidado con la videollamada de Eli para asegurarnos de que<sb>esa información se reforzaba de inmediato.<sb>Olga, el personaje que se presenta aquí,<cr>se incluyó para dejarlo<sb>más claro todavía llamando al jugador<cr>cuando sale del ascensor.<sb>Olga es el primer personaje que<cr>el jugador conoce en persona. Su diálogo aquí,<sb>y también en el callejón, se creó para reforzar<cr>el hecho de que está<sb>conversando con el jugador y que la voz femenina<sb>incorpórea que este escucha es Alyx respondiendo.<sb>Esto fue más difícil de transmitir en la videollamada de Eli, ya que aparece<sb>Russell hablando a través de una pantalla.<cr>Sin embargo, en esta escena no hay<sb>nadie en el espacio conversacional,<cr>excepto Olga y el jugador.<sb>Sin Olga, descubrimos que, aunque ya habían hablado con Eli y Russell<sb>en la videollamada, los jugadores de pruebas seguían sin sentir que eran Alyx.
Cuando comenzamos el proyecto de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, teníamos mucha curiosidad por averiguar<sb>de qué modo la realidad virtual afectaría a la creación de la música.<sb>La música en <I>Half-Life<I> siempre había sido escasa,<sb>y a menudo se reducía a los sonidos ambientales del mundo como fondo acústico.<sb>No obstante, es una herramienta que nos gusta usar para destacar los momentos<cr>en los que el estado del mundo<sb>ha cambiado de forma importante. En este caso, algo ha alterado a la Alianza.<sb>En las primeras pruebas de esta escena, sin música, pero con muchos<sb>elementos visuales y acústicos representados, descubrimos que algunos jugadores<sb>no comprendían que debían avanzar,<sb>y otros se distraían con los objetos<sb>interactivos de la lavandería.<sb>Hemos experimentado con música "de acción" muy simple para transmitir<sb>la variación del nivel de amenaza que supone la Alianza, además de la intención<cr>de la historia de que Alyx<sb>vaya a un lugar seguro. Descubrimos que esto hacía que los jugadores recordaran<sb>con más facilidad la misión y progresaran para lograr el objetivo.<sb>Hemos mantenido una música sencilla y "cinemática" para que se combine<sb>con los sonidos de fondo complementarios y que así comience<sb>a normalizarse el uso de la música en realidad virtual de forma natural.<sb>Este éxito nos animó a emplear<cr>la misma técnica en escenas<sb>con requisitos similares en<cr>etapas posteriores del juego.
El resto de este nivel se ha diseñado para seguir<cr>informando al jugador del mundo<sb>en el que se encuentra y para reforzar el aumento del nivel de alerta de la Alianza.<sb>También queríamos incluir detalles<cr>para darle vida a la ciudad,<sb>algo que resulta mucho más difícil más tarde, cuando el jugador ya tiene un arma.<sb>Diseñar esto fue complicado debido al desafío con el que solemos encontrarnos:<sb>el conflicto entre el estado de la historia<cr>y el del juego.<sb>Aquí, la narrativa indica que Alyx<cr>debería regresar con Eli<sb>con la mayor rapidez y sigilo posibles.<sb>No obstante, esto sucede al principio del juego, y los jugadores siguen descubriendo<sb>los límites de lo que pueden ver y tocar.<sb>Como era de esperar, las pruebas nos mostraron que algunos jugadores se volcaban<sb>en seguir la historia y pasar a otra zona,<cr>mientras que otros ignoraban<sb>la narrativa por completo y exploraban<cr>hasta el último rincón.<sb>Aunque es tentador eliminar todas las distracciones para intentar hacer que<sb>los jugadores sigan la narrativa,<cr>esto iría en detrimento de<sb>la complejidad de nuestro mundo y de cómo<cr>el juego pretende recompensar<cr>a los jugadores por explorarlo.<sb>Por eso nos pasamos meses perfeccionando esta parte; añadiendo, modificando<cr>y quitando elementos.<sb>Hemos intentado dar con el nivel de tensión narrativa adecuado, para que los jugadores sientan<sb>que deben continuar, pero sin precipitarse,<cr>y que así exploren<sb>los elementos que ofrece el juego.<sb>Hemos incluido suficientes objetos interactivos y momentos narrativos en los que siempre<sb>se recompensa a los jugadores por explorar, pero hemos diseñado todas esas distracciones<sb>para que acaben rápidamente y así fomentar que los jugadores sigan avanzando.
Para reducir la posibilidad de marearse<cr>que podría producirse<sb>cuando el jugador se desplaza en un vehículo, inicialmente planeamos<sb>esta escena con la idea de que Alyx se despertara después de la colisión de la furgoneta.<sb>Esto decepcionaba a los jugadores, ya que parecía que el juego estaba<sb>omitiendo un momento emocionante que podían haber vivido por sí mismos.<sb>Para abordar este asunto, tuvimos que lidiar<cr>con el problema técnico<sb>de que el jugador pudiera moverse<cr>en un vehículo con comodidad.<sb>En esta furgoneta y en el tren del final del mapa, verás que el mundo<sb>exterior solo se puede ver<cr>a través de ventanas pequeñas.<sb>Estas vistas exteriores son necesarias para ofrecer un paralaje de movimiento,<sb>y su reducido tamaño garantiza que el campo visual siempre estará dominado por<sb>el interior del vehículo, que es el marco de referencia lógico del jugador.<sb>Esto reduce considerablemente<cr>la posibilidad de marearse.<sb>Además del paralaje del mundo exterior,<cr>hemos usado luz animada<sb>y hemos creado sonidos determinados para reproducir el efecto de ir en un vehículo.
El último mapa se centró en transmitir al jugador una gran cantidad de información<sb>sobre el estado del mundo, y en este debemos comenzar con la misión más importante.<sb>Eso significa que el jugador debe salir<cr>de este mapa sabiendo qué le<sb>ha sucedido a Eli y cómo actuar al respecto.<sb>El jugador también debe conocer a Russell<cr>para ponerle rostro<sb>a la voz de la radio que escuchará a lo largo del juego.<sb>Por último, queríamos que el jugador consiguiera los guantes de gravedad<sb>y la pistola, y que aprendiera a utilizarlo todo.<sb>Sí, puede resultar abrumador.<sb>Por propia experiencia, sabemos que, si lo juntamos todo en un único escenario,<sb>los jugadores solo recordarán<cr>un par de elementos destacados.<sb>Por lo tanto, el fin de este mapa es<cr>crear un ritmo narrativo:<sb>tenemos que separar<cr>los eventos necesarios con suficiente<sb>tiempo y espacio para que los jugadores los digieran y recuerden todos.<sb>Al mismo tiempo, nos sentíamos bajo presión,<cr>en cierto modo.<sb>Las pruebas mostraron que, a estas alturas, algunos usuarios habían jugado<sb>durante 30 minutos y se preguntaban cuándo<cr>iban a aparecer los enemigos.
Uno de los primeros pasos que tomó el equipo<cr>de guionistas fue escribir<sb>una escena entre Russell y Alyx que abarcase todo el diálogo que necesitábamos.<sb>Como el jugador ve a Russell por primera vez<cr>y se producen varios<sb>eventos importantes en el juego<cr>que Alyx y Russell deben comentar,<sb>la escena acabó conteniendo<cr>una gran cantidad de diálogo.<sb>Sabíamos que era imposible crear una escena tan larga sin aburrir a los jugadores<sb>y que los elementos más importantes pasarían desapercibidos en medio de tanto diálogo.<sb>Una de las primeras herramientas que empleamos para abordar esto fue<cr>la introducción del dron de Russell.<sb>Nos permitió coger trozos del diálogo<cr>de esa escena original<sb>y distribuirlos en la zona previa a ese momento.<sb>De este modo, la escena en sí podía saltarse<cr>los preámbulos narrativos<sb>y pasar directamente al objetivo fundamental.
Además de narrar la historia a un ritmo más dosificado, este mapa tenía que<sb>seguir comunicando el estado del mundo, más allá de la zona de cuarentena.<sb>También queríamos que los jugadores supieran en qué parte de la cronología<sb>se encuentra <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> dentro del universo<cr><I>Half-Life<I> y que vieran por sí mismos la<cr>envergadura de la Ciudadela en construcción.<sb>El poder de la Alianza se hace patente con su indiferencia hacia la humanidad.<sb>Han conquistado la Tierra con facilidad<sb>y ahora la están expoliando para sus propios fines.<sb>Han hecho un esfuerzo mínimo en su campaña política, pero les es bastante indiferente.<sb>Posteriormente, en <I>Half-Life 2<I>, vemos los intentos de Breen por hablar más<sb>seriamente con la humanidad, pero no queda claro si son instrucciones<sb>de la Alianza o si no es más que un intento de Breen de ayudarla.<sb>Sea como sea, la construcción de la Alianza<cr>es brutalmente eficiente.<sb>Los omnipresentes cables de alimentación<cr>de la Ciudadela no intentan<sb>integrarse en las vidas de los habitantes mientras la Alianza consume la energía de la ciudad.<sb>Dentro de este entorno, un guiño nostálgico a<cr><I>Half-Life 2<I>, este enorme cable,<sb>atraviesa la pared y simboliza la falta<sb>absoluta de interés de la Alianza<cr>por la historia de la ciudad.
En el laboratorio de Russell el jugador está<cr>en la misma sala con<sb>otro personaje por primera vez, lo que plantea uno de los principales retos a los que<sb>nos enfrentamos cuando diseñamos escenas coreografiadas en realidad virtual:<sb>lograr que el jugador no invada el espacio<cr>de los personajes, y viceversa.<sb>En títulos anteriores de <I>Half-Life<I>,<cr>siempre podíamos desplazar<sb>al jugador a la fuerza si <I>necesitábamos<I><cr>que se apartara.<sb>Hemos probado varias formas de obtener una solución similar con la realidad virtual,<sb>pero descubrimos que los jugadores solían sentirse muy incómodos o desorientados.<sb>Por eso diseñamos estos espacios<cr>de forma que ofrecieran<sb>una separación natural entre el jugador<cr>y los demás personajes.<sb>Donde no podía haber separadores naturales, tuvimos que impedir que los jugadores<sb>se dirigieran al espacio del personaje<cr>y eliminar esa limitación<sb>en cuanto el personaje se apartara.<sb>Otro desafío fue equilibrar la asiduidad con la que los personajes respondían<sb>a las acciones del jugador mientras transmitíamos información narrativa relevante.<sb>En pruebas iniciales, permitimos que el diálogo de los personajes se interrumpiera,<sb>lo que les permitía responder<cr>al jugador de inmediato<sb>y después proseguir con el diálogo.<sb>Aunque técnicamente era una opción sencilla, resultó increíblemente complicado ejecutarla con naturalidad en la animación y los diálogos.<sb>La combinación de usar las reacciones específicas necesarias para transmitir la gama<sb>de posibles interacciones con el jugador<cr>para después regresar<sb>al diálogo narrativo resultó ser un caos absoluto.<sb>Finalmente, llegamos a una solución con la que permitimos solo un mínimo<sb>de interacciones durante secciones narrativas importantes y una gama<sb>de respuestas mayor ante reacciones más complejas una vez que se ha terminado la escena.<sb>Para Russell, hemos hecho que mire sutilmente hacia el jugador y establezca<sb>contacto visual natural, además de sus acciones, mientras habla con Alyx.<sb>Después de la escena en la que escribe<cr>con el ordenador, reacciona cuando<sb>los jugadores tratan de tocarlo<cr>o si se arrojan objetos.
Desde que comenzamos a experimentar con la realidad virtual, descubrimos que<sb>los jugadores esperaban un nivel de fidelidad acústico considerable, incluso en las<cr>más mínimas interacciones,<sb>especialmente cuando los sonidos se corresponden con algo que se ve claramente.<sb>Por ejemplo, en uno de nuestros juegos anteriores habría sido aceptable<sb>usar una secuencia genérica de sonidos de teclas de ordenador cuando Russell escribe.<sb>Sin embargo, con la realidad virtual, sabemos que el jugador puede observar las animaciones<sb>muy de cerca e incluso poner la cabeza junto al teclado de Russell, si así lo desea.<sb>En este caso, los jugadores se percatarían de que no había una correspondencia<sb>directa entre la animación y el sonido de las teclas.<sb>En <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, hemos creado<cr>una secuencia de sonidos<sb>de teclas individuales que se activan<cr>con la animación.<sb>Por ejemplo...<sb><wait:2>Cuando los dedos de Russell se mueven para pulsar una tecla, se reproduce<sb>uno de esos sonidos, lo que resulta en una sincronización precisa entre animación y sonido.
Una de las frustraciones de la realidad virtual para los jugadores es tener que agacharse<sb>físicamente para coger objetos del mundo virtual, sobre todo<sb>si tienen limitaciones espaciales en el mundo real.<sb>Una solución habitual es buscar la forma de llevar los objetos al jugador<sb>en lugar de obligarlo a acercarse para cogerlos.<sb>Sabíamos que esto sería una característica importante de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><sb>y sus enormes niveles. Además, los jugadores querrían explorar todos los rincones de ese mundo.<sb>No queríamos que la mecánica pareciera muy falsa o cosa de magia, así que decidimos<sb>incorporarla en la ficción del juego mediante<sb>los guantes de gravedad, un precursor natural de la pistola antigravedad de <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Esto nos permitió introducir la mecánica<cr>como una acción física real<sb>fruto de la tecnología del universo del juego.<sb>Para enfatizar la cualidad física específica de la realidad virtual,<sb>hemos hecho que el movimiento se active con un gesto, en vez de pulsando un botón,<sb>y que después el jugador<cr>tenga que agarrar el objeto,<sb>en lugar de que se pegue<cr>automáticamente en la mano.<sb>Gracias a esto, la mecánica resulta más natural y está más integrada en el universo<sb>del juego, lo que permite que el jugador se sienta más realizado y con un control mayor.
Cuando el jugador atrae un objeto<cr>con los guantes de gravedad, usamos<sb>el motor físico del juego para aplicar una fuerza de lanzamiento sobre el objeto con una trayectoria<sb>influenciada parcialmente por la dirección del gesto que realiza el jugador.<sb>Hemos fijado la velocidad de lanzamiento del objeto en un tiempo de desplazamiento<sb>estándar desde que se atrae hasta que se coge, para que el jugador se adapte al ritmo y termine reaccionando de forma automática.<sb>Queremos asegurarnos de que<cr>el objeto llega a la mano;<sb>por ello, después del lanzamiento inicial, seguimos aplicando pequeñas fuerzas de impulso<sb>por toda la trayectoria<cr>(representada por flechas blancas).<sb>Dichos impulsos sirven para contrarrestar la gravedad y compensar las colisiones<sb>con obstáculos que se encuentren por el camino, desplazando continuamente el objeto<sb>hacia la mano, que es un objetivo en movimiento.<sb>Un límite generoso para coger el objeto<cr> y una vibración sutil cuando este<sb>se puede agarrar prácticamente garantizan que terminará en la mano del jugador<sb>aunque este se esté centrando<cr>en otro elemento del juego.<sb>Otra ventaja de implementar esto con la física del juego es que no hizo falta personalizar<sb>la manipulación de los objetos en función<cr>de su tamaño, masa o inercia.<sb>Además, esto también compensa automáticamente la inusual gravedad con la que<sb>se encuentran los jugadores dentro de la bóveda<cr>al final del juego.
Incluso durante las primeras pruebas para llevar el universo <I>Half-Life<I> a la realidad virtual,<sb>descubrimos que los jugadores disfrutaban explorando todos los rincones de su alrededor.<sb>Gracias a la mayor fidelidad de la realidad virtual, los jugadores no solo esperaban<sb>interactuar con una gran variedad de objetos, sino que también anhelaban encontrar algo de utilidad de vez en cuando.<sb>Esta sensación estaba tan extendida entre los jugadores de pruebas que, además de añadir<sb>más lugares para explorar y objetos interactivos, incluimos un recurso nuevo: la resina.<sb>Los diseñadores de niveles podían colocar este nuevo recurso en lugares interesantes y divertidos<sb>que no guardaran relación con el progreso del juego para recompensar<<cr>a los exploradores más concienzudos.<sb>También vinculamos este nuevo recurso a un objetivo a largo plazo con las mejoras<sb>de armas, lo que motivaba más aún a los jugadores para explorar el entorno.<sb>Las búsquedas más exhaustivas y la observación más minuciosa se veían recompensadas<cr>con más resina.
A este tipo de rompecabezas, el equipo de desarrollo lo llama conexión eléctrica<sb>debido a su similitud con una herramienta real que se utiliza<sb>para encontrar cableado eléctrico en las paredes.<sb>Este tipo de mecánica se ideó para que los diseñadores pudieran crear experiencias<sb>de juego sabiendo que el jugador tendría que situar la cabeza<sb>y las manos en ubicaciones determinadas.<sb>El diseño inicial solo necesitaba que el jugador usara la multiherramienta<sb>para empujar una bola de energía por un camino, como en los laberintos de motricidad para niños.<sb>Aunque este diseño tan sencillo sirvió para que el jugador pusiera la cabeza<sb>y las manos en ubicaciones determinadas, la falta de diversificación<sb>implicaba que el jugador no tendría que tomar ninguna decisión,<sb>por lo que no podía haber consecuencias negativas.<sb>Para abordar estos problemas, incorporamos las intersecciones rotatorias,<sb>que permitían la diversificación de rutas y se convirtieron en el principal medio<sb>del que dispone el jugador para interactuar con las conexiones eléctricas. Aunque estos rompecabezas aumentan su complejidad a lo largo del juego,<sb>el primero se diseñó para usar una cantidad mínima de elementos,<sb>con el fin de presentar a los jugadores las ideas principales: la energía fluye por los cables,<sb>se puede redirigir al rotar intersecciones y esto tiene un efecto<sb>en el mundo físico, como encender luces o abrir puertas.<sb>La toma eléctrica chispeante que se ramifica hacia el suelo<sb>no es estrictamente necesaria en este sencillo rompecabezas, pero se añadió<sb>para que los jugadores se familiarizaran con él, ya que<sb>resultaba confuso en rompecabezas posteriores,<sb>al verlo por primera vez en configuraciones más complejas.
Desde las primeras pruebas con la realidad virtual, nos percatamos de<sb>la importancia de una iluminación de alta calidad y densidad para ofrecer un mundo más realista.<sb>Durante el desarrollo de un juego, cualquier decisión tecnológica implica hacer<sb>malabares entre la calidad, el rendimiento del tiempo de ejecución y el tiempo de desarrollo.<sb>En el caso de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, optamos por un mapeado de luz de<sb>alta calidad y rendimiento, lo que requería una cantidad significativa<cr>de procesamiento previo sin conexión.<sb>Realizamos el procesamiento previo del mapeado de luz con una granja de renderizado,<sb>lo que tardaba varias horas para crear un único mapa con la mayor calidad.<sb>Nos esforzamos al máximo<cr>para mitigar el coste de todo<sb>el tiempo que los diseñadores del equipo emplearon con las repeticiones.<sb>Más concretamente, implementamos una aproximación en tiempo real del resultado<sb>de iluminación definitivo. Esto permitió a los diseñadores iluminar escenas en tiempo real<sb>sabiendo que los mapeados de luz de alto rendimiento lograrían su intención. La mayoría de las luces de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> se integran en<cr>un único término<sb>que describe la disipación de luz y el sombreado. Esto nos permitió modificar<sb>el brillo y el color de las luces en tiempo real<cr>y sin ningún coste.<sb>Además, esta codificación nos permitió aplicar sombras en personajes<sb>y elementos dinámicos sin tener que recurrir a geometría estática en los mapas de sombras.<sb>Nuestros mapeados de luz almacenan información direccional mediante la popular<sb>codificación "Ambient Highlight Direction", una mejora de la técnica<sb>"Radiosity Normal Mapping" de Valve que se usó por primera vez en <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Esta nueva codificación del mapeado de luz garantiza que las superficies irregulares se mostrarán así aunque la luz no se proyecte directamente sobre ellas.<sb>Esta fuente de luz intermitente ilustra a las mil maravillas la técnica:<sb>se pueden percibir los detalles de la superficie incluso cuando la luz está apagada.
Las lapas, una criatura emblemática de la saga<cr><I>Half-Life<I>, presentaron<sb>una serie de desafíos relacionados con la realidad virtual de lo más interesantes.<sb>Aunque la lengua está diseñada para pillar desprevenidos a jugadores apresurados<cr>o poco atentos,<sb>quienes quedaban atrapados no solían darse cuenta de qué estaba pasando.<sb>Cuando la lapa los lanzaba por los aires<cr>antes de devorarlos,<sb>los jugadores se desorientaban o sufrían mareos.<sb>Los jugadores que corrían esta suerte solían morir<sb>sin enterarse de qué ocurría, incluso<cr>tras varios encuentros.<sb>Para resolver este problema, rediseñamos la lengua como un sistema de partículas.<sb>Esto nos permitió realizar una simulación física<sb>y colocarla de forma que se garantizara<cr>su visibilidad.<sb>Si una lapa atrapa al jugador, la lengua<cr>siempre aparecerá<sb>delante de su cara, independientemente de hacia dónde intentara mirar.<sb>De este modo, es casi imposible no ver la lengua, que hace que el jugador<sb>centre su visión en la posición de la lapa y sepa hacia dónde tiene que disparar para zafarse.<sb>Los gráficos de asfixia que aparecen cuando se levanta al jugador no solo<sb>sirven para comunicar el daño que sufre,<cr>sino también para<sb>reducir la posibilidad de mareos, ya que se centra su vista en un lugar concreto.<sb>Estos cambios, combinados con los efectos de sonido y otras imágenes, como ver<sb>estrellas o el fundido en negro, eliminaron la confusión de algunos jugadores<sb>y nos permitieron incorporar este clásico enemigo al mundo de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.
Recibimos muchos comentarios positivos en las pruebas iniciales, en las que<sb>les pedimos a los jugadores que realizaran una serie de acciones físicas para recargar la pistola.<sb>En concreto, les pedimos que sacaran el cargador, cogieran uno nuevo de la mochila,<sb>lo insertaran en la pistola y metieran una bala en la recámara.<sb>Los jugadores disfrutaron mucho aprendiendo esta habilidad y perfeccionándola.<sb>Probamos a usar un único botón para sacar un cargador y meter la bala en la recámara,<sb>pero resultó más interesante asignar un botón diferente para cada acción,<sb>aunque fuese más complicado mentalmente.<sb>El hecho de que sea más complicado es lo que lo hace más interesante,<sb>ya que los jugadores suelen liarse con los botones cuando están bajo presión.<sb>En las primeras etapas del juego, los jugadores buscaban torpemente los cargadores<sb>y los sacaban cuando lo que querían era meter una bala en la recámara. Las consecuencias eran caóticas cuando menos.<sb>A quienes estuvimos observando las pruebas nos dio la impresión de que<sb>las cosas habían salido fatal, pero los jugadores a menudo mencionaban eso como uno de los puntos fuertes de las partidas.<sb>Debido a la naturaleza física de las recargas y la destreza que requieren,<sb>los jugadores se culpaban a sí mismos y no al juego por los errores cometidos<sb>mientras aprendían la secuencia.<sb>En esta zona, incluimos una serie de blancos estáticos en forma de lapas<sb>para que los jugadores disparasen a su ritmo, aumentando la probabilidad<sb>de que deban recargar el arma varias veces antes de avanzar.
En <I>Half-Life<I> anteriores en los que se asumía el papel de Gordon, el jugador veía a Alyx usando<sb>su multiherramienta para hackear los sistemas de seguridad de la Alianza y así abrir puertas o realizar otros actos de sabotaje.<sb>Esto nos dio la oportunidad de mostrar las habilidades de Alyx como pirata informática con minijuegos donde se aprovecha la realidad virtual.<sb>Todos los minijuegos de hackeo se diseñaron teniendo en cuenta<sb>que el juego hace un seguimiento independiente de cabeza y manos, algo característico de los sistemas actuales de realidad virtual.<sb>Queríamos animar a los jugadores a usar ambas manos al mismo tiempo<sb>y mover la cabeza para crear paralaje y comprender las<cr>relaciones espaciales de los rompecabezas.<sb>Este rompecabezas se basa en uno de nuestros primeros prototipos,<sb>en los que el jugador debía usar una herramienta con una mano<sb>para pintar un camino en una esfera que sostenía con la otra.<sb>Era divertido e interesante usar todos los grados de libertad<sb>naturales que ofrecía emplear ambas manos para resolver un rompecabezas en realidad virtual.<sb>En su versión más simple, la solución de este rompecabezas es bastante sencilla,<sb>pero la dificultad aumenta gradualmente conforme se avanza en el juego,<sb>introduciendo obstáculos estáticos o en movimiento de diferentes tamaños y formas en la esfera.
En los primeros prototipos, los jugadores se podían curar cogiendo un botiquín<sb>de <I>Half-Life 2<I> y pulsando un botón del mando.<sb>Obviamente, esta no es una interacción muy interesante en realidad virtual.<sb>Durante el desarrollo de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, el equipo de Counter-Strike<sb>añadió las jeringuillas de salud en CS:GO como parte del modo de juego Danger Zone<sb>que estaban desarrollando.<sb>Cuando vimos esto, pensamos que una jeringuilla también podría funcionar<sb>como objeto curativo intuitivo en un entorno de realidad virtual.<sb>Los jugadores tendrían que pulsar un botón para preparar la jeringuilla, indicando así<cr>su intención de usarla.<sb>Esto evitaba que se utilizara por error<cr>y nos dio la oportunidad<sb>de mostrar la cualidad física<cr>de esta interacción mediante<sb>la vibración, la animación y el sonido.<sb>Algunos jugadores incluso sentían aversión ante la idea de tener<sb>que clavarse una jeringuilla y apartaban la vista<sb>cuando realizaban la acción.<sb>También tuvimos que crear aproximaciones de los brazos y el cuerpo del personaje,<sb>ya que los jugadores de pruebas tenían sus propias preferencias respecto a dónde clavarse la jeringuilla.<sb>Incluso añadimos la opción de administrarla<cr>en la cabeza, puesto que<sb>muchos jugadores probaron la jeringuilla ahí para ver si funcionaba.
Queríamos asegurarnos de que los jugadores perfeccionaban la técnica<sb>de recargar la pistola en los primeros niveles. De lo contrario, los encuentros futuros serían demasiado difíciles.<sb>El mapa anterior solo incluía blancos estáticos en forma de lapas.<sb>Los jugadores podían atacar a las lapas a su ritmo,<sb>pero había bastantes como para que tuvieran que recargar el arma unas cuantas veces.<sb>El primer zombi en movimiento está atrapado en la valla metálica, y no puede alcanzar<sb>al jugador hasta que este se acerque y dispare al candado de la puerta.<sb>La posición de los zombis en la siguiente parte del juego se ha diseñado<sb>para que haya que recargar muchas veces y asegurarse de que el jugador perfecciona esta habilidad.
La realidad virtual ofrece la oportunidad de añadir una cualidad física al juego,<sb>pero hay que tener en cuenta el cansancio del jugador y la accesibilidad.<sb>Por ejemplo, en esta zona probamos con un techo bajo y los jugadores<sb>tenían que agacharse todo el tiempo para abrirse paso<sb>por la parte superior de los vagones.<sb>A los jugadores de pruebas no les agradaba pasar tanto tiempo agachados,<sb>así que subimos la altura del techo.
Los paneles de cristal que se rompen en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> son un sistema más diseñado<sb>para convencer a los jugadores de que se encuentran en un mundo vivo y dinámico.<sb>Los paneles detectan la posición de un impacto inminente y generan de manera<sb>procedimental nuevos paneles de cristal más pequeños con un patrón radial alrededor de la posición de impacto.<sb>Estos nuevos paneles se pueden romper en paneles más pequeños, y así sucesivamente.<sb>Descubrimos que los jugadores a menudo rompían paneles de cristal por accidente<sb>y después pasaban tiempo "probando" cómo interactuar con ellos<sb>para romperlos más y comprobar que, en efecto,<sb>el cristal se rompía en la ubicación correspondiente.<sb>En un momento dado, probamos a crear rompecabezas especiales con cristales<sb>que se rompieran, pero al final descubrimos que el cristal sería más apropiado como elemento<sb>interactivo pasivo del mundo, que reacciona de forma satisfactoria ante<sb>distintos impactos,<cr>desde ataques de zombis a disparos<sb>u otros tipos de interacciones físicas del juego.
Las mejoras de armas son una función nueva de la saga <I>Half-Life<I> y,<sb>en la ficción, esta mecánica encaja a la perfección con el afán de Alyx de trastear con las cosas.<sb>Primero abordamos este reto planteándonos el tipo de mejoras<sb>que podrían ser significativas y ofreciendo un valor adicional a los<sb>jugadores sin eliminar las interacciones fijas.<sb>Como la resina es un recurso limitado, el sistema de mejoras también ofrecía a los jugadores<sb>la posibilidad de personalizar e invertir en su arma favorita,<sb>o bien centrar una interacción de otra arma, aumentando así su valor.<sb>Por ejemplo, con la mira réflex los jugadores siguen teniendo que apuntar manualmente,<sb>pero indica mejor dónde impactarán los disparos<sb>y muestra puntos débiles del enemigo que antes estaban ocultos.<sb>Aunque a algunos jugadores les gustaron las nuevas oportunidades que esto ofrecía,<sb>otros prefirieron centrarse en mejoras que encajasen más con su <I>propio<I> estilo de juego.<sb>Esto permitió a los jugadores gastar su resina limitada en las mejoras que más les interesaran.<sb>Otro aspecto de las mejoras de armas en el que quisimos centrarnos no fue<sb>tan evidente cuando empezamos a diseñar y probar los combates en realidad virtual.<sb>Los combates en realidad virtual son más físicos y esto puede agotar<sb>las capacidades física y mental de algunos jugadores, ya que deben usar<sb>ambas manos y mover la cabeza para asimilar el entorno mientras se enfrentan a los enemigos.<sb>Aunque esta es una experiencia muy natural, es cierto que hay que estar<sb>pendiente de muchas cosas mientras recargas y luchas.<sb>A medida que observábamos a los jugadores en algunos de estos intensos combates,<sb>hallamos oportunidades de incorporar mejoras para reducir la cantidad<sb>de veces que era necesaria una interacción física, o bien<sb>disminuir la complejidad de una interacción en particular.<sb>Un buen ejemplo de esto es el cargador automático de la escopeta.<sb>Cuando lo incorporamos a la escopeta, la acción metódica y habitualmente lenta<sb>de cargar cartuchos en el arma se reduce a una interacción más rápida y sencilla,<sb>que consiste en meter los cartuchos en el cargador automático para que se introduzcan solos.<sb>Esto permite que los jugadores observen su entorno, se centren menos en el arma mientras recargan<sb>y presten atención a lo que los rodea.
Cuando comenzó el proyecto de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, nuestra idea era que los jugadores<sb>realizaran descansos tras 30 o 45 minutos,<sb>ya que era lo que habíamos visto con <I>The Lab<I> y otras<sb>experiencias de realidad virtual menores<cr>disponibles por aquel entonces.<sb>Por este motivo, diseñamos el ritmo de los niveles del juego<sb>pensando en sesiones con esta duración.<sb>Sin embargo, durante el desarrollo, el juego fue incorporando más tiempo de inactividad<sb>entre los intensos combates, y la comodidad<sb>de los nuevos cascos de realidad virtual había mejorado considerablemente.<sb>De hecho, conforme avanzaba el juego, descubrimos que los jugadores podían pasarse horas y horas sin descanso.<sb>Al terminar una prueba, los jugadores solían decir que nunca habían tenido<sb>una sesión tan larga en realidad virtual.
Hasta este punto, los jugadores solo han visto<sb>cangrejos adheridos a las cabezas de los zombis.<sb>Los jugadores de pruebas que conocieran a los cangrejos por juegos anteriores<sb>ya sabían que se los encontrarían sin compañía.<sb>Decidimos aprovechar esta anticipación anunciando el primer encuentro con un cangrejo<sb>que sale de un respiradero antes de desaparecer, además<sb>de añadir sonidos de cangrejos en el entorno, incluyendo un terrorífico sonido<sb>de cangrejo procedente de la puerta parcialmente sellada<cr>que hay luego.
Las marcas de los muros de esta zona tienen dos capas:<sb>los diseños de cuadrados y puntos, elementos funcionales del<sb>rompecabezas del entorno, y el mural que representa la interpretación<sb>del vortigaunt de los eventos de la saga <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Durante los primeros años de desarrollo, esta zona solo tenía los diseños<sb>de puntos que conforman el rompecabezas de perspectiva. Cuando desarrollamos<sb>el resto del nivel, descubrimos que los jugadores de pruebas reaccionaban<sb>positivamente a las marcas en la pared del vortigaunt que conducían a la guarida.<sb>En este punto, nos dimos cuenta de que esta zona podría ser el lienzo<sb>para la obra maestra del vortigaunt.<sb>Para ello, organizamos los diseños de puntos en una especie de espiral de estrellas<sb>detrás de la creación del vortigaunt.<sb>La iconografía, inspirada en los petroglifos y otro tipo arte tradicional en piedra,<sb>representa varios eventos significativos de la invasión de la Alianza,<sb>pintados apresuradamente por un vortigaunt herido, como si tratase<sb>de capturar los fugaces recuerdos que le quedaban<sb>de la vortesencia de la que se había desprendido.<sb>El hecho de que los vortigaunts tengan una relación complicada con el tiempo<sb>nos dio libertad respecto a trazar una cronología lineal y estricta.<sb>Por ejemplo, puede que te hayas dado cuenta de que el vortigaunt usa tropas de la Alianza<sb>contemporáneas para representar las invasiones del pasado, o que la cronología<sb>es algo imprecisa en general: se mezclan el pasado,<sb>el presente y eventos futuros de <I>Half-Life 2<I>.
En el juego hay varios temas y motivos musicales que representan<sb>aspectos tácitos de la historia y las tradiciones de este mundo.<sb>Por ejemplo, los vortigaunts juegan un papel fundamental en la trama secundaria<sb>del juego, por lo que decidimos usar la música para transmitir sutilmente la naturaleza<sb>repetitiva de su función en la cronología<cr>de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><sb>y en la línea temporal mayor de la saga <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>En la música de esta escena, oirás variaciones de los temas empleados<sb>en la línea temporal: desde los primeros sonidos<sb>del juego hasta el final en la bóveda.<sb>Las variaciones de estos motivos representan el canto constreñido de los vortigaunts,<sb><wait:13>la extracción de su energía para confinar a G-man<sb><wait:7>y sonidos históricos familiares que simbolizan<cr>la vortesencia.<sb><wait:21>
Durante los primeros intentos de dar forma narrativa a Alyx, el instinto<sb>nos decía que la joven debía reaccionar a absolutamente todo.<sb>No obstante, las pruebas mostraron que todas estas reacciones de Alyx<sb>podían resultar excesivas y poco atractivas.<sb>Por ejemplo: un jugador está en un nivel muy intenso, infestado de zombis,<sb>disfrutando del momento y, de repente,<cr>Alyx está en su cabeza hablando<sb>enfadada, asustada o nerviosa.<sb>Estas reacciones de Alyx creaban una discordancia entre los sentimientos<sb>del jugador y cómo se sentía el personaje con el que jugaban.<sb>Por eso, decidimos quitar<cr>gran parte de esas reacciones.<sb>Las reacciones de Alyx que hemos mantenido suelen ser aquellas<sb>consideradas prácticamente universales.<sb>Esta reacción a la surrealista entrada a la guarida del vortigaunt es un buen ejemplo.<sb>Es algo tan distinto a todo lo que el jugador ha visto<sb>hasta entonces que es inevitable sentir sorpresa.<sb>Visualizamos muchísimas pruebas en las que el jugador lo veía y decía:<cr>"Hala, qué raro".<sb>Así que Alyx repite lo mismo un segundo después, como si fuera un eco.
Al preparar escenas coreografiadas como esta, descubrimos desde el principio<sb>que hay dos tipos de jugadores: los que se quedan absortos con los personajes<sb>y los que trastean con todo lo que los rodea<sb>y apenas prestan atención a lo que sucede<cr>en la escena.<sb>Para que los más curiosos sientan interés<cr>por estos entornos,<sb>solemos incluir objetos<cr>que puedan encontrar y examinar.<sb>Como esta escena se divide en dos salas, pudimos añadir un gran número<sb>de interacciones en la primera,<cr>para que los jugadores<sb>las descubrieran después de que el vortigaunt pasara a la segunda sala.<sb>Algunos de los objetos interactivos eran cosas puramente físicas,<sb>como los cadáveres de los cangrejos<cr>y las sartenes colgadas.<sb>Otros eran animaciones que se activaban con las acciones del jugador,<sb>como la reacción de los cangrejos enjaulados cuando te acercas o los disparas.<sb>Un tipo de objeto sobre la mesa<cr>es un corazón de cangrejo<sb>que ha quedado de una versión anterior de esta escena en la que el jugador<sb>reanimaba a un vortigaunt herido exprimiendo néctar de estos corazones.<sb>Aunque la escena no funcionó, nos pareció que la experiencia era cautivadora<sb>y, bueno, bastante <I>asquerosa<I> como para quitarla del juego.
El desafío principal en cualquier escena dramática coreografiada como esta<sb>es asegurarse de que entretenemos al jugador sin que se reduzca<sb>la información fundamental<cr>que el juego busca transmitir.<sb>En este caso, el jugador debía salir de esta escena sabiendo que los<sb>vortigaunts están prisioneros y que debe buscar<cr>la Estrella del Norte.<sb>Esta escena en concreto pasó por muchas variaciones en la fase de desarrollo,<sb>desde una escena de cocina con un traumatizadísimo vortigaunt,<sb>hasta esta versión más humorística.<sb>Incluso probamos una interacción en la que el jugador debe exprimir el néctar<sb>de varios corazones de cangrejo<sb>en la boca del vortigaunt para reanimarlo.<sb>Aunque esta era una interacción memorable y novedosa en realidad virtual,<sb>y garantizaba que el jugador<cr>se metiera de lleno en la escena,<sb>los jugadores de pruebas acababan recordando las <I>acciones<I> que habían realizado,<sb>pero no la información fundamental del juego.<sb>Finalmente, optamos por una escena<cr>mucho más humorística,<sb>que ofrece un equilibrio ideal entre entretenimiento y la transmisión de la información deseada.<sb>No solo eso; también repartimos la escena<cr>en dos salas distintas,<sb>desgranando así la información que se transmite en dos pasos: en la primera sala,<sb>el jugador encuentra al vortigaunt<cr>y descubre su situación;<sb>en la segunda, el jugador descubre<cr>un nuevo objetivo.<sb>Al parecer, separar estos elementos en salas ayuda a los jugadores a retener<sb>de forma más fiable la información fundamental que se transmite en la segunda sala.<sb>Aunque esta escena pasó por muchos cambios, una parte de la historia<sb>permaneció prácticamente igual<cr>desde el primer esbozo:<sb>el momento en que el vortigaunt lanza el cadáver de un cangrejo al jugador y grita "¡Sustento!".<sb>Desde el principio, este momento<cr>causó una gran reacción<sb>entre los jugadores, por lo que se quedó así en el producto final.
Invertimos tiempo en todos los elementos del diseño del juego, pensando en cómo<sb>el jugador debería descubrir su existencia<cr>y comprender cada detalle.<sb>Algunos elementos del diseño son tan importantes que la experiencia se arruinaría<sb>si el jugador no los entendiera. Otros son simples entretenimientos secundarios<sb>o recompensas por explorar los sistemas del juego.<sb>Cualquier elemento necesario exigirá un esfuerzo por nuestra parte para enseñárselo al jugador.<sb>En <I>Half-Life<I>, intentamos explicar los elementos<cr>con la mayor naturalidad posible,<sb>combinándolos con el desarrollo principal del juego para que no dé la impresión<cr>de que el juego se ha interrumpido para enseñarte algo.<sb>No siempre lo logramos, pero los intentos<cr>suelen conducir a algo interesante.<sb>En este caso, debemos hablar a los jugadores<cr>del cangrejo blindado.<sb>Los elementos clave que queremos que comprendan son que el cangrejo es<sb>inexpugnable por la parte superior,<cr>y que su punto débil está en el vientre.<sb>También queremos que sepan que el cangrejo mostrará ese punto débil justo antes<sb>de saltar, pero esto no es necesario;<cr>el jugador puede retirarse<sb>para disparar a ese punto mientras el cangrejo<cr>se mueve tras haber saltado.
Enseñar los elementos del diseño de los enemigos no es una tarea sencilla.<sb>Los jugadores llevan años dejándonos claro<cr>que es muy difícil<sb>aprender algo nuevo mientras te están atacando.<sb>También hemos visto que la invulnerabilidad<cr>es una característica<sb>enemiga especialmente compleja de mostrar.<sb>Si los jugadores están atacando a un enemigo,<cr>no suelen prestar especial atención<sb>a la repercusión de los impactos.<sb>Si el enemigo es vulnerable en algunas zonas<cr>y en otras no, los jugadores pueden matarlo<sb>con una ráfaga de disparos<cr>y no percatarse<sb>de que algunos de sus tiros no causaron ningún daño, mientras que otros alcanzaron puntos débiles.<sb>Cuando tuvimos que diseñar el entrenamiento sobre los cangrejos blindados,<sb>sabíamos que haría falta un esfuerzo extra.<sb>El primer paso fue evitar poner al jugador<cr>en una situación de presión;<sb>para ello, contuvimos a los enemigos en esta valla de alambre.<sb>Después, colocamos cangrejos al nivel<cr>de la vista del jugador,<sb>exponiendo su punto débil, que brilla y late.<sb>Si el jugador dispara a uno de inmediato,<cr>disfrutará de un efecto de muerte único:<sb>el cangrejo explotará en pedazos.<sb>Este efecto se ha diseñado para mostrar al jugador que ha hecho algo especial<sb>para matar a este cangrejo, algo distinto a cómo había estado matando a los demás cangrejos<cr>hasta ese momento.<sb>En esta configuración hay un par de elementos más que son importantes.<sb>Hay un segundo cangrejo detrás del sistema<cr>de cierre, y el jugador debe dispararlo<sb>para entrar en la jaula.<cr>Esto ayuda a que se percate de su punto débil y trate de apuntarlo al disparar.<sb>Hay dos cangrejos más en la jaula,<cr>programados para que ataquen<sb>repetidamente puntos invisibles<cr>en la valla de alambre.<sb>De este modo, dejamos clara la forma<cr>en la que exponen sus puntos débiles<sb>antes de saltar, lo que permite que<cr>el jugador practique los tiros<sb>a esa zona tras la valla,<cr>sin exponerse a ningún peligro.
Con cualquier sección de entrenamiento<cr>natural y entramado, observamos que<sb>es difícil explicar algo de forma que<cr>todos los jugadores lo comprendan,<sb>y nunca el 100 % de los jugadores termina comprendiéndolo todo como nos gustaría.<sb>Si la comprensión del jugador es fundamental, tenemos que construir un sistema<sb>infalible que garantice que el jugador lo haya entendido antes de poder avanzar.<sb>De hecho, es lo que hacemos cuando el jugador consigue la escopeta en la siguiente zona.<sb>Sin embargo, en el caso del cangrejo blindado,<cr>las pruebas mostraron que<sb>no pasaba nada si algunos jugadores no lo comprendían todo a la perfección.<sb>Esta sección les permitió experimentar lo suficiente como para comprender de qué iba la cosa,<sb>y los encuentros futuros con otros cangrejos blindados reforzaban ese conocimiento.<sb> El diseño visual del cangrejo también sirve<cr>para diferenciar todavía más<sb>su caparazón y su punto débil,<sb>y añadimos una reacción específica<cr>a los disparos de escopeta.<sb>En ese caso, el cangrejo blindado se da la vuelta<sb>y se retuerce un segundo,<cr>exponiendo así su punto débil.<sb>El objetivo de esto fue impedir<cr>que malgastaran tantos recursos<sb>los jugadores a los que les seguía costando entender la mecánica del cangrejo blindado<sb>después de adquirir la escopeta.
Uno de los desafíos a los que siempre nos enfrentamos cuando le damos un arma<cr>o herramienta nueva<sb>al jugador es asegurarnos<cr>de que la coge antes de avanzar.<sb>En estos casos, intentamos crear<cr>una especie de obstáculo<sb>que el jugador solo pueda superar<cr>si usa este nuevo objeto.<sb>Esto puede resultar especialmente complicado<cr>en situaciones en las que,<cr>por ejemplo, el jugador recibe<sb>una herramienta nueva que no altera radicalmente sus capacidades,<sb>como sucede con la escopeta,<cr>ya que con ella puede hacerse<sb>prácticamente lo mismo que con la pistola.<sb>En cambio, el obstáculo que requería que<cr>el jugador consiguiera la pistola,<sb>que consistía en romper el candado de la valla<cr>del laboratorio de Russell de un tiro,<sb>fue fácil de diseñar y de ejecutar.<sb>En el caso de la escopeta, no solo debíamos asegurarnos de que el jugador la recogía,<sb>sino también de que aprendía a cargarla<cr>antes de continuar.<sb>Probamos distintos métodos para enseñar<cr>la mecánica de recarga<sb>durante los combates, y en repetidas ocasiones vimos que no funcionaba.<sb>Cuando los jugadores deben aprender una tarea nueva y compleja bajo presión,<sb>suelen recurrir a la pistola,<cr>ya que es un arma que ya saben usar.
Cuando el jugador consigue la escopeta,<sb>solo ha superado la mitad del obstáculo.<sb>El siguiente paso es aprender a recargarla.<sb>Para que el jugador sienta la necesidad de aprender a usar esta nueva arma,<sb>decidimos alertarlo de un peligro inminente mediante varios efectos sonoros y visuales.<sb>Aunque nuestro objetivo es que el jugador sienta que tiene un límite de tiempo,<sb>en realidad esta presión es falsa<cr>y todo sucede conforme el jugador carga<cr>la escopeta por primera vez.<sb>Una vez que se carga la escopeta,<cr>empieza una cuenta atrás<sb>y, cuando termina,<cr>los zombis empiezan a salir por los muros.<sb>Si el jugador se detiene a observar los muros<cr>antes de que acabe el tiempo,<sb>la cuenta atrás se cancela y los zombis hacen<cr>su entrada triunfal.<sb>Combinar una cuenta atrás con una activación visual es un truco común que se emplea<sb>en lugares donde queremos<cr>que el jugador vea un momento clave<sb>que no puede esperar eternamente.<cr>De lo contrario, el juego no avanzaría.<sb>Que los zombis atraviesen los muros representa<sb>la etapa final del obstáculo de la escopeta.<sb>Hacer que los nuevos enemigos abran<cr>una vía para seguir adelante<sb>al entrar en el espacio del jugador<cr>es un método muy eficaz,<sb>aunque nunca ha sido muy de nuestro agrado.<sb>Resulta demasiado oportuno y elimina la parte activa que le corresponde al jugador.<sb>Sin embargo, en un entorno como este,<cr>que contiene un rompecabezas nuevo,<sb>un arma nueva y la mecánica correspondiente, además de una emboscada,<sb>ya hay demasiada complejidad de diseño<sb>en tan poco espacio.<cr>Cualquier elemento nuevo<sb>podría complicar las cosas mucho más.
El diseño visual de la escopeta presentó varios desafíos.<sb>Por lo general, las escopetas suelen ser armas muy potentes en los juegos,<cr>y eso se refleja en su tamaño.<sb>Como resultado, es un arma grande que debe sujetarse con ambas manos.<sb>Sin embargo, los experimentos en realidad virtual con las armas de dos manos<sb>no resultaron del todo satisfactorios.<sb>Cuando sostienes un objeto así en la vida real, sientes una conexión<sb>física entre ambas manos y esto permite a los<sb>jugadores dejar de pensar en él conscientemente, además de proporcionar una sensación física.<sb>En la realidad virtual, sin sentir ninguna conexión<cr>ni sensación, si los jugadores<sb>no interiorizaban constantemente<cr>la idea de que llevaban<sb>un arma con ambas manos, terminaban poniéndolas en posiciones que nos resultaban difíciles de gestionar.<sb>Como resultado, las armas de dos manos obligaban a los jugadores a estar más pendientes<cr>de lo que queríamos.<sb>Uno de nuestros principales objetivos en<cr><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> era que los jugadores<sb>se sumergieran en la experiencia y se olvidaran<cr>de lo que estaban haciendo<sb>en la vida real. Por eso, hemos optado por centrarnos en armas de una sola mano,<cr>y esto incluye la escopeta.
Nuestro instinto inicial a la hora de diseñar la escopeta fue basarnos en una real,<sb>pero la modificamos con una culata<cr>y un cañón recortados para que<sb>pareciera menos complicado<cr>sostenerla con una mano.<sb>El resultado era que la empuñadura siempre se encontraba en la parte trasera<sb>del arma, por lo que parecía<cr>más pesada por delante.<sb>Obviamente, el mando de realidad virtual<cr>no reflejaba esto, y se producía<sb>una desconexión entre lo que el jugador ve<cr>y lo que siente.<sb>Esta desconexión podía aliviarse colocando la empuñadura más al centro y debajo del arma.<sb>El centro de masas implícito no se sostenía del todo a medida que el arma<sb>iba obteniendo mejoras durante el juego, pero la primera impresión era la más importante.<sb>Puesto que la forma no es común, estábamos decididos a usar elementos visuales<cr>de una escopeta normal<sb>siempre que fuera posible, para que el jugador la reconociera y el diseño fuera más realista.<sb>Un elemento real que utilizamos fue un cargador de escopeta común que lleva<sb>los cartuchos en paralelo al cañón,<cr>y logramos cumplir<sb>por los pelos el requisito del juego de 6 cartuchos sin que la longitud total resultase aparatosa.<sb>La mejora del cargador automático es un buen ejemplo del esfuerzo que hizo falta para ofrecer una mayor capacidad de munición. Nuestra primera mecánica de recarga se basaba en la inserción de cartuchos individualmente,<cr>que es la opción más realista.<sb>Esto resultó ser un fastidio para los jugadores de pruebas, si bien recibimos algunos<sb>comentarios positivos, ya que algunos se sentían como el protagonista de una película de acción.<sb>La solución a este problema fue muy sencilla: permitimos que los jugadores metieran<cr>dos cartuchos al mismo tiempo.<sb>De este modo, logramos conservar la parte buena del diseño y eliminar la mala.<sb>Nos gustaba la idea de la sensación<cr>de prota de peli de acción<sb>y probamos a añadir algún gesto característico que pudiera hacer el jugador para finalizar la recarga.<sb>La incorporación de un mecanismo de cierre<cr>nos permitió añadir un paso más<sb>en la recarga que la distinguía de las demás armas<sb>y ofrecía un movimiento de muñeca satisfactorio que completaba la acción.
Al igual que con la escopeta y la pistola, necesitábamos un obstáculo para la linterna,<sb>para asegurarnos de que el jugador no pueda avanzar sin ella.<sb>Probamos con varios diseños para el momento en que el jugador conseguía<sb>la linterna, pero al final todo se limitaba<cr>a recoger un objeto,<sb>independientemente de que fuera una linterna.<sb>Teniendo en cuenta que la función principal de una linterna es iluminar,<sb>pensamos que el obstáculo debía ser<cr>una zona oscura.<sb>Además, queríamos que el jugador tuviera ganas de conseguir la linterna<sb>y, por ello, debía experimentar dicha oscuridad antes de obtener el objeto.<sb>Esto ofreció un reto de lo más interesante, porque ya había muchas zonas<sb>con escasa iluminación previas a este momento. Ahora necesitábamos una zona tan oscura<sb>que los jugadores supieran que<cr>no podrían avanzar sin más.<sb>Nuestra idea inicial era asegurarnos de que no había ningún tipo de luz en el pasillo.<sb>Sin embargo, durante las pruebas, comprobamos que eso no era suficiente.<sb>Algunos visores de realidad virtual tienen un nivel de negro muy bajo; en estos casos,<sb>se reflejaba luz suficiente como para que los jugadores avanzaran sin problema.<sb>Además, la niebla del suelo ofrecía suficiente contraste en el pasillo oscuro<sb>para que los jugadores pudieran orientarse y atravesarlo a tientas.<sb>Incluso tras eliminar la niebla y la luz reflejada de esta zona,<sb>los jugadores seguían intentando avanzar.<sb>Algunos jugadores disparaban repetidamente con la pistola, usando el destello de los tiros como fuente de luz intermitente.<sb>Otros empleaban la interfaz de teletransporte para rastrear la sala.<sb>En esa fase del proyecto,<cr>esta llevaba incorporada<cr>una pequeña luz.<sb>Al final, optamos por deshabilitar los destellos en el pasillo y la interfaz de teletransporte perdió su luz.<sb>El último paso fue añadir el diálogo de Alyx,<cr>en el que menciona la oscuridad<cr>y que necesita algo<cr>para iluminar el camino.<sb>La idea era resolver un problema de percepción.<sb>Hasta ahora, el juego había enseñado a los usuarios que su objetivo era seguir<sb>avanzando y que, si el progreso se bloqueaba de algún modo,<sb>era porque había algo en esa zona que debían investigar y resolver.<sb>Conociendo dicha estructura, es lógico que los jugadores hagan todo lo posible<sb>para buscar la forma de ver<cr>en la oscuridad y avanzar.<sb>El diálogo de Alyx busca informar de que<cr>el juego reconoce<sb>los intentos de avanzar en esta zona, pero que la solución está en otra parte.<sb>En pruebas posteriores, vimos que este diálogo, junto con la zona<sb>bien iluminada y con zombis de la derecha,<sb>servía para alejar a los jugadores de la entrada oscura y llevarlos hacia la linterna.
Al igual que los rompecabezas de hackeo y de entorno, las conexiones eléctricas como esta<sb>a menudo sirven para reducir la tensión<cr>del combate y motivar al jugador.<sb>Este rompecabezas introduce<cr>un nuevo tipo de intersección,<sb>con dos entradas y dos salidas,<cr>además de circuitos que se ramifican.<sb>A nivel funcional, no es más que<cr>un simple compartimento estanco;<sb>solo uno de los principales accesos de la Alianza puede activarse a la vez,<sb>con una vuelta de tuerca extra:<cr>el acceso secundario más pequeño<sb>del camino de vuelta<cr>se tiene que desactivar por separado.<sb>Además de ofrecer un respiro<cr>de los frenéticos combates,<sb>este rompecabezas sirve para repasar la mecánica, puesto que el jugador lleva tiempo<sb>sin ver conexiones eléctricas,<cr>y las siguientes van a ser más complejas.
En juegos de <I>Half-Life<I> anteriores,<cr>el personaje llevaba la linterna encima,<sb>por lo que el mundo siempre se iluminaba<cr>desde el mismo ángulo<sb>respecto al punto de vista del jugador.<sb>Con el seguimiento de manos en realidad virtual, teníamos la oportunidad de permitir que<cr>los jugadores manipulasen directamente la linterna.<sb>Los jugadores de pruebas reaccionaron muy favorablemente<cr>a esta nueva libertad.<sb>De hecho, la primera incorporación<cr>de una linterna en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><sb>fue un objeto que se podía recoger con cualquier mano o incluso dejar en el suelo.<sb>Esto permitía posar la linterna en cualquier parte para que iluminara un lugar<sb>mientras el jugador<cr>se ocupaba de otra tarea.<sb>Por desgracia, esto podía dar pie a<cr>que el jugador se olvidase la linterna,<sb>lo que acabaría impidiéndole progresar en el juego.<sb>Al hacer que la linterna sea un objeto que<cr>los jugadores debían sostener, evitamos<sb>que llevaran <I>otra<I> cosa en esa mano,<sb>lo que resultaba bastante fastidioso<sb>y no compensaba.<sb>En especial, la recarga de armas<cr>resultaba una tortura,<cr>porque el jugador ya no tenía una mano libre<cr>para realizar esta acción.<sb>Al final, creamos una linterna que se acopla<cr>a la mano libre<sb>y se enciende y se apaga automáticamente.<sb>Esto resuelve el problema de recargar<cr>en la oscuridad y la posibilidad de perder<sb>la linterna.<sb>Además, tiene la ventaja de que no necesita<sb>un botón para encenderse,<cr>lo que es de gran ayuda en mandos con menos botones.<sb>Gracias a que el encendido y apagado automático se controlan mediante niveles lógicos,<sb>los diseñadores pudieron equilibrar el rendimiento<cr>y la calidad en diferentes áreas del juego.<sb>Al fin y al cabo, si un jugador podía encender<cr>la linterna en cualquier momento,<sb>el coste de renderizado para crear<cr>la sombra de esta fuente de luz<sb>debería tenerse en cuenta durante todo el juego.<sb>Por otra parte, si la linterna está <I>apagada<I> en una zona específica,<sb>el diseñador puede aprovechar<cr>el margen de renderizado<sb>y aumentar la fidelidad del entorno de otras formas.
Poco después de añadir la linterna al juego, descubrimos que los jugadores<sb>de pruebas sujetaban la mano con la que empuñaban el arma con la de la linterna.<sb>Esto implicaba que los jugadores tenían que orientar la mano de la linterna<sb>de forma extraña para alinear la luz<cr>hacia donde apuntaran.<sb>Decidimos convertir esto en un comportamiento automático de la mano libre<sb>cada vez que se acercara<cr>a la empuñadura del arma.<sb>Si intentas hacerlo, verás que la mano libre<cr>agarra el arma<sb>con una postura natural y que la linterna se ajusta hacia donde estés apuntando.<sb>De hecho, si te fijas en el extremo de la linterna,<sb>verás que tiene una junta esférica.<sb>Esto permite que la linterna se mueva dependiendo<sb>de si la mano libre está sosteniendo un arma o no.<sb>Esta junta esférica tiene cuatro orientaciones:<sb>una para cada arma y otra neutra<cr>para cuando el jugador<sb>no sostiene el arma para apuntar.<sb>Estas cuatro orientaciones garantizan<cr>que la linterna siempre<sb>esté apuntando en la dirección óptima<cr>para el jugador.<sb>En el modo de una mano,<cr>la linterna se acopla a la mano de la pistola<sb>con una orientación óptima para cualquier situación.
Cuando los guionistas crean un personaje nuevo, tratamos de preparar varios materiales<sb>desde la perspectiva de ese personaje para ayudarlo a encontrar su identidad.<sb>¿Qué lo impulsa a actuar? ¿Cómo suena?<sb>¿Cómo está relacionado con otros personajes?<sb>Nos resulta de gran ayuda conocer las respuestas a estas preguntas en la primera etapa de un proyecto,<sb>sobre todo al trabajar en un equipo en el que varias personas distintas le dan forma a ese personaje.<sb>La historia del sándwich club<cr>que Russell cuenta en esta parte<sb>fue uno de los primeros ejercicios<cr>de redacción que hicimos.<sb>El equipo de guionistas escribió páginas y páginas donde Russell le cuenta a Alyx historias<sb>sobre la vida antes de la Alianza,<cr>enfadándose con ella,<sb>contando chistes malos... En resumen,<cr>todo un abanico de emociones.<sb>Conforme pulíamos al personaje de Russell,<cr>casi todo se acabó desechando.<sb>Esas cosas fueron un paso necesario para dar forma a Russell, pero la mayoría ya no encajaban con su forma de ser.<sb>En una etapa posterior del proyecto, decidimos que a Alyx la aterraría la oscuridad.<sb>Por eso, necesitábamos que Russell hablase mucho en esta parte y le hiciera compañía a Alyx.<sb>Lo importante no era <I>qué<I> decía;<cr>solo tenía que oírse su voz<sb>en la oscuridad para que Alyx se aferrara a ella.<sb>De repente, recordamos una cosa:<sb>¿No habíamos escrito algo sobre un sándwich hace un año?<sb>Y así fue cómo rescatamos el monólogo del sándwich club.
Cuando creamos un juego de <I>Half-Life<I>,<cr>intentamos empezar a probarlo<sb>lo antes posible,<cr>aunque solo tengamos<cr>10 o 15 minutos de juego.<sb>Nos resulta de mucha utilidad ver lo antes posible cómo reaccionan los jugadores a nuestro trabajo.<sb>Una de las formas más relevantes en las que estas pruebas afectaron a <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> fue descubrir<sb>cómo reaccionaban los jugadores a la densidad<cr>de los elementos interactivos del mundo.<sb>Antes de comenzar, ya éramos conscientes de que los jugadores se pasarían más tiempo<sb>fijándose en los detalles del mundo que los rodeaba en realidad virtual,<sb>pero no estábamos preparados<cr>para el impacto que esto causaría.<sb>Fue revelador ver cómo algunos jugadores se pasaban treinta minutos interactuando<cr>con un único objeto.<sb>Como resultado de estas observaciones,<cr>gran parte de nuestro desarrollo<sb>se centró en el entorno que rodea al jugador<sb>y en el nivel de detalle e interacción<cr>que puede encontrar.<sb>Tal vez resulte chocante que<cr>no empezáramos dando por sentado<sb>que tendríamos que pasar tanto tiempo<cr>en el mundo, pero la realidad<sb>del desarrollo de un juego es que disponemos de una cantidad de tiempo determinada<sb>para diseñarlo, y siempre hay que sacrificar cosas.<sb>Lo ideal es dedicar el tiempo del que disponemos en lo que contribuya<sb>en mayor medida a mejorar<cr>la experiencia del jugador.<sb>Por lo tanto, comenzar cuanto antes las pruebas<cr>y descubrir qué elementos<sb>contribuyen a la experiencia de juego nos ayuda a averiguar en qué debemos<cr>invertir ese tiempo limitado.<sb>En este caso, las pruebas iniciales revelaron que debíamos aumentar considerablemente<sb>el tiempo dedicado a crear detalles del mundo<cr>y la interacción con ellos.
Las lapas son un tipo de enemigo único de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, en el sentido de que son<sb>estáticas y suelen encontrarse en el campo visual natural del jugador.<sb>Durante las pruebas en espacios cerrados o escasamente iluminados, los jugadores solían<sb>darse de bruces con las lenguas de las lapas sin percatarse de su presencia.<sb>Una forma de resolver este conflicto<cr>fue mediante sonidos.<sb>En especial, hicimos que las lapas que estaban quietas emitieran un sonido de respiración muy sutil,<sb>además de otros gruñidos y graznidos, como estos.<sb><wait:9>Estos sonidos ayudaban a advertir a los jugadores de que había lapas cerca, además<sb>de recordarles que son criaturas vivas que siempre están activas, y no solo una parte<sb>mecánica del juego que responde únicamente a las acciones del jugador.<sb>Las funciones de transferencia relacionadas con la cabeza disponibles en Steam Audio resultaron de gran ayuda,<sb>ya que nos permitieron diseminar los sonidos<cr>de las lapas<sb>para que los jugadores supieran<cr>que procedían de arriba.
Las primeras representaciones de las robosierras resultaron un enemigo frustrante en realidad virtual,<sb>ya que los sonidos que emitían no ofrecían suficiente información sobre su ubicación.<sb>La sensación era que aparecían de la nada y, aunque estuvieran cerca del jugador,<sb>carecían de presencia dramática.<sb>Probamos varios sonidos por capas con diferentes disminuciones de distancia,<sb>pero esto solo servía para crear más confusión, sobre todo si había cerca muchas robosierras.<sb>La solución definitiva a este problema se dividió en dos partes.<sb>La primera fue hacer que las robosierras emitieran un sonido de aviso similar a una alarma<sb>cuando se acercaban por primera vez o si las desplegaba un soldado de la Alianza.<sb><wait:2>La segunda parte de la solución consistió en añadir más sonidos agresivos en bucle con distancias de disminución cortas.<sb><wait:4>La corta distancia de estos bucles sonoros implicaba que este componente específico<sb>del tratamiento del sonido de las robosierras solo se oyera cuando estuvieran muy cerca del jugador.<sb>Por lo tanto, cuando los jugadores oían estos sonidos, sabían que las robosierras<sb>los perseguían y que al menos una estaba tan cerca como para suponer una amenaza.
Antes de añadir el diseño final, a los jugadores no les costaba mucho atravesar las zonas más oscuras y angostas de este nivel.<sb>Sin embargo, conforme aumentaba la fidelidad del juego, los jugadores tardaban más<cr>en llegar a este punto.<sb>Si hay algo que hemos aprendido con los años, es que a los jugadores les agota pasar mucho tiempo<sb>en zonas oscuras y subterráneas. Esto es mucho más palpable en un entorno de realidad virtual.<sb>Esta sección exterior proporciona un cambio de ritmo y un pequeño descanso de tanta oscuridad.<sb>No solo ofrece algo diferente e interesante<cr>a nivel visual, sino que<sb>permite a los jugadores ver con claridad e identificar las amenazas en un espacio abierto<sb>para que puedan matar a enemigos fácilmente<cr>y sin tanta presión.<sb>Aquí también fue importante ofrecer algo de variedad, ya que los jugadores<sb>están a punto de entrar en una zona oscura que requiere disparos precisos y usar la linterna.
Esta parte, donde hay muchos barriles explosivos entre la vegetación de Xen,<sb>se diseñó para modificar las expectativas<cr>del jugador<sb>y el ritmo del nivel.<sb>Antes de llegar a este punto del juego, los barriles<sb>y los botes explosivos se empleaban<cr>como armas ofensivas.<sb>En este espacio resultan letales para el jugador:<sb>si un barril o bote de humo explota, se desata una reacción en cadena mortal.<sb>Este cambio de prioridades obliga<cr>a los jugadores a apuntar<sb>con cuidado, lo que añade intensidad<cr>sin necesidad de luchar.<sb>Esto tiene un efecto secundario positivo,<cr>ya que entrena<sb>a los jugadores para usar la pistola<cr>de forma mucho más efectiva.<sb>Aunque la alineación automática de la linterna al agarrar un arma<sb>es útil en un combate directo, en esta parte vimos que los jugadores<sb>aprovechaban el arma y la linterna<cr>por separado mientras<sb>iluminaban y atacaban a las lapas de la compleja vegetación de Xen.
Al principio del proyecto decidimos que los entornos que queríamos ofrecer en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><sb>se beneficiarían de una inversión en iluminación volumétrica de gran calidad.<sb>Este componente de iluminación es una herramienta indispensable, no solo para crear<sb>atmósfera, sino también para atraer la atención del usuario hacia elementos fundamentales del juego.<sb>Nuestro sistema funciona en tres fases.<sb>En la primera, la iluminación procedente de fuentes de luz estáticas se captura<sb>en un "clipmap" volumétrico jerárquico de tres niveles que rodea al jugador.<sb>El mayor nivel de resolución del "clipmap" mide una pulgada cúbica por vóxel.<sb>El "clipmap" se actualiza de forma ascendente, menos de una vez por fotograma,<sb>a medida que el jugador atraviesa el escenario.<sb>En la segunda fase, una marcha de rayos volumétricos de sombreado<cr>creada en el espacio de visión<sb>atraviesa los "clipmaps" a la vez que acumula luz estática y dinámica, así como extinción volumétrica.<sb>La marcha de rayos se ejecuta en cada fotograma y emplea el suavizado de bordes temporal<cr>para mejorar la calidad.<sb>En la última fase, repetimos el muestreo de luz y la diseminación volumétrica<sb>de la fase anterior para cada ojo,<cr>una vez por cada fotograma.<sb>El resultado es una textura que describe una diseminación y extinción volumétricas<sb>para cualquier profundidad de espacio visualizado, que aplicamos en el renderizado posterior.
Siempre presentamos a los enemigos nuevos desde lejos,<sb>y jamás cuando el jugador está bajo presión.<sb>Aquí, el jugador puede observar cómo los soldados de la Alianza matan<sb>a unos zombis. Esto refleja claramente su poder<sb>y su destreza en combate.<sb>Hemos colocado la Alianza a suficiente distancia como para que<sb>no se percate de la presencia del jugador, pero lo bastante cerca como para que este<sb>pueda elegir atacarla desde una posición relativamente segura.
El primer encuentro con un soldado de la Alianza<sb>causó una serie de problemas durante las pruebas.<sb>El mayor fue que los jugadores se sobresaltaban<sb>cuando el soldado empezaba a dispararles.<sb>Para quienes jugaban por primera vez a un título de la saga <I>Half-Life<I><sb>era toda una sorpresa, porque no sabían quiénes eran estos tipos.<sb>Sin embargo, habían pasado muchas horas desde que los jugadores habían visto a un humano,<sb>y descubrimos que muchos de ellos no disparaban de inmediato.<sb>Algunos jugadores incluso se preguntaban por qué Alyx no dudaba ni un momento en matar a otros humanos.<sb>Esta zona se diseñó para demostrar que los soldados de la Alianza son hostiles<sb>y atacarán nada más verte, lo que le da al jugador un motivo para disparar.<sb>Comienza con el diálogo que precede al encuentro, donde el jugador oye<sb>a la Alianza hablando sobre el problema de los carroñeros en la zona de cuarentena.<sb>Después, cuando el jugador logra establecer contacto visual con<sb>el primer soldado de la Alianza, observa cómo este<sb>está ejecutando a un carroñero civil.
La IA de los soldados del pelotón ha sido una piedra angular de la saga <I>Half-Life<I>, por lo que<sb>estábamos deseando ver cómo se reflejaría<cr>el diseño en realidad virtual.<sb>Las primeras pruebas contra la IA del soldado<cr>de la Alianza de <I>Half-Life 2<I><sb>en realidad virtual dejaron claras<cr>un par de cosas de inmediato.<sb>Primero, que a los jugadores no les gusta que les disparen y suelen tener<cr>una reacción negativa visceral a esto.<sb>Estos soldados a menudo corrían hacía los jugadores a toda velocidad mientras disparaban,<sb>y descubrimos que la velocidad de combate<cr>de <I>Half-Life 2<I> resultaba demasiado abrumadora<cr>en realidad virtual.<sb>Además, los jugadores tardaban más en hacer cualquier cosa en realidad virtual,<cr>sobre todo la acción<sb>principal de avistar y apuntar al enemigo<cr>con el arma mientras están a cubierto.<sb>Como resultado, los soldados aguantaban mucho más tiempo vivos en realidad virtual<cr>que en <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<cr>Con estas primeras pruebas, nos quedó claro que la reacción<sb>más común entre los jugadores era ponerse a cubierto de los disparos enemigos.<sb>Debido a esto, empezamos a probar<cr>una serie de cambios en la IA del soldado<sb>con la idea de ofrecer una experiencia de combate basada en la tendencia<cr>de los jugadores a protegerse.<sb>Los primeros experimentos se centraron<cr>en mantener a una distancia segura<sb>a los soldados de la Alianza,<cr>con suficiente movimiento<sb>para que el combate no fuera demasiado estático.<sb>Para crear situaciones en las que los jugadores dejen de estar a cubierto y disparen,<sb>impedimos que los soldados ataquen mientras corren, en la mayoría de los casos.<sb>Para evitar que los jugadores se queden quietos, creamos el concepto de desalojar:<sb>los pelotones intentan hacer que<cr>el personaje deje de cubrirse,<sb>y le dimos a cada clase de soldado<cr>un método distinto para hacerlo.<sb>No obstante, incluso durante las primeras pruebas también quedó claro que<cr>los jugadores no eran capaces<sb>de luchar contra los soldados hasta haber dominado varias acciones básicas de combate,<sb>como recargar el arma sin tener que centrar<cr>toda su atención en ello.<sb>Por lo tanto, introdujimos gradualmente<cr>a los diferentes tipos de soldado,<sb>e incluso las características individuales<cr>de cada clase.<sb>Por ejemplo, las primeras peleas contra la Alianza solo cuentan con los soldados básicos,<sb>que además no llevan granadas.<sb>Esto significa que no pueden hacer que<cr>el jugador deje de cubrirse.<sb>En estos primeros combates, descubrimos que era importante darles a los jugadores<sb>el tiempo necesario para aprender a usar<cr>la cobertura de forma eficaz,<sb>antes de empezar a introducir enemigos que pudieran tratar de hacerlos salir.
En este punto, sabíamos que necesitábamos<cr>una gran escena; un momento<sb>sin combates para recompensar a los jugadores por haber logrado atravesar<cr>los túneles oscuros y tenebrosos.<sb>No solo eso, sino que el ritmo<cr>de la historia conducía hacia<sb>el momento más relevante hasta entonces:<cr>el rescate de Eli Vance.<sb>Estrellar el tren cárcel de la Alianza que transportaba a Eli parecía la decisión correcta<sb>para lograr estos objetivos y nos dio la oportunidad de crear un espectáculo en realidad virtual.<sb>Queríamos lograr el caos cinemático<cr>de provocar un descarrilamiento<sb>y darles a los jugadores un papel activo.<sb>Nuestros primeros intentos de diseñar<cr>el escenario fueron todo un reto.<sb>Dirigir la atención del jugador no resultó<cr>tan fácil como asegurarse<sb>de que estaba en la posición adecuada<cr>mediante las mecánicas de juego.<sb>Durante las pruebas iniciales, muchos jugadores no veían parte del descarrilamiento,<cr>¡o no lo veían en absoluto!<sb>El choque era una de las primeras secuencias de destrucción que incluíamos en el juego,<sb>así que nos faltaba mucho por aprender sobre cómo se comportan los jugadores<cr>en un entorno de realidad virtual<sb>y cómo dirigirlos de forma natural<cr>para que se sumerjan en el caos.<sb>Además, para lograr siempre la frecuencia de fotogramas deseada, debíamos crear<sb>una serie de eventos sucesivos, para que solo parte de esa destrucción tuviera lugar<cr>en cada momento específico.<sb>El diseño de sonido y del nivel, los efectos<cr>y la animación debían coordinarse<sb>meticulosamente para dirigir la atención del jugador hacia cada etapa de la colisión.<sb>Por ejemplo, al comienzo del descarrilamiento, usamos los sonidos de vagones<sb>apilándose en la distancia para que los jugadores mirasen hacia esa dirección<sb>antes de que uno de los vagones se levante<cr>y atraviese el conector de cemento.<sb>Al final de la secuencia, el colapso<cr>de la chimenea se emplea para dirigir<sb>la atención del jugador hacia el camino<cr>que debe seguir, y queríamos que observara su destrucción.<sb>Antes de derribar la chimenea, les dimos a los jugadores un breve respiro y,<sb>una vez más, recurrimos al sonido para atraer<cr>su atención hacia la chimenea.<sb>En un principio, usamos un sonido estruendoso previo al colapso, pero descubrimos<sb>que era demasiado sutil en la práctica<cr>y optamos por añadir el sonido<sb>de una explosión transitoria para dirigir la atención del jugador hacia la chimenea.
Para el rescate de Eli, queríamos crear<cr>un momento tenso en el que estuviera<sb>justo fuera del alcance del jugador,<cr>que acababa salvándolo físicamente.<sb>No obstante, para que funcionase<cr>el resto de la historia, Alyx y Eli<sb>debían seguir caminos distintos al final de la escena.<sb>Probamos con varias opciones, incluida una versión en la que Eli estaba colgando<sb>de una cornisa justo delante del jugador, que podía<sb>tratar de cogerle la mano a Eli y ayudarlo a subir.<sb>Sin embargo, resultó que las manos de los jugadores chocaban con el suelo del mundo real.<sb>Esto imposibilitaba que los jugadores<cr>alcanzaran a Eli y, además,<sb>los sacaba del momento,<cr>lo cual arruinaba la emoción de la escena.<sb>Como Eli y Alyx deben tomar caminos distintos,<cr>se nos ocurrió que ella lo rescatase,<sb>pero que estuviera herido<cr>y no pudiera continuar.<sb>Por desgracia, muchos jugadores se quedaban ahí y se negaban a abandonarlo a su suerte.<sb>Finalmente, hallamos una solución que fue<cr>la que terminó en el producto final.<sb>Separar a Eli del jugador con el rescate del vortigaunt hizo que el regreso<sb>tuviese mucha más relevancia y reforzara la promesa del vortigaunt de ayudar a Alyx.<sb>El dispositivo de datos que encontró Eli fue una incorporación que no solo nos permitió integrarlo<sb>de nuevo en la historia,<cr>sino también darle un propósito,<sb>un motivo de peso para no acompañar al jugador durante el resto de la aventura.
En las primeras etapas del proyecto, estuvimos mucho tiempo experimentando<sb>con la clásica palanca de <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Las pruebas nos mostraron que era una herramienta muy interesante para que los jugadores la usaran<sb>en rompecabezas y para interactuar con el mundo. Sin embargo, no estábamos muy satisfechos con los combates cuerpo a cuerpo.<sb>Para nosotros era importante que la palanca reaccionara con el mundo y los enemigos<sb>como un objeto sólido, y esto ocasionó varios desafíos físicos de lo más complejos.<sb>Los jugadores podían empujar sin problemas la palanca hacia un enemigo que tuvieran delante,<sb>porque no había nada en el mundo real que se lo impidiera.<sb>Sin esa respuesta física del mundo real,<sb>los jugadores de pruebas mostraban una gran variedad de movimientos.<sb>Algunos sacudían el mando rápidamente, mientras que otros empleaban todo el cuerpo.<sb>Al mismo tiempo, la respuesta de las pruebas al prototipo de la pistola fue muy favorable,<sb>sobre todo por la compleja mecánica de recarga.<sb>Al enfrentarnos a un posible problema importante de I+D en los combates cuerpo a cuerpo,<sb>optamos por centrarnos en los combates a distancia.<sb>Tampoco fue de mucha ayuda que todos los jugadores relacionaran la palanca con Gordon Freeman y no con Alyx Vance.
Toda esta sección del mapa, desde el comienzo del rompecabezas con la tarjeta<sb>hasta esta sala, se añadió especialmente para mostrarle la bóveda al jugador.<sb>Sin este pequeño desvío, los jugadores verían la bóveda por primera vez<sb>desde la entrada del Hotel Estrella del Norte,<sb>que también sería cuando verían la primera subestación de la Alianza.<sb>Tanta información nueva al mismo tiempo podría hacer que muchos jugadores confundieran la bóveda<sb>con la subestación, o que la ignoraran por completo, así que creamos esta zona<sb>de la estación de tren para que destacara.<sb>Aunque los jugadores deben entrar en esta sala para conseguir la segunda tarjeta,<sb>no tenían por qué fijarse en la bóveda del exterior, así que añadimos<sb>un diálogo con Russell mencionándola para que así miraran por la ventana.<sb>Tal vez sea una solución un poco tosca, pero teníamos que resolver el problema<sb>de que los jugadores no reconocieran la bóveda cuando la vieran en un punto posterior del juego.
Aunque los lanzamientos puedan parecer una interacción muy básica<sb>de la realidad virtual, lograr que quede bien requiere un gran esfuerzo.<sb>Si queremos crear rompecabezas como este, en el que el jugador debe<sb>lanzar una granada activada por un conducto elevado, los lanzamientos deben<cr>funcionar a la perfección.<sb>Un juego en realidad virtual común que vaya a 90 fotogramas por segundo lee<sb>la información del sensor de los mandos de seguimiento una vez por fotograma.<sb>Esto quiere decir que la información<cr>se lee cada 11 milisegundos.<sb>Esto puede parecer muy poco tiempo, pero, al realizar un lanzamiento, el usuario todavía puede<sb>mover la mano 15 centímetros o más en ese espacio de tiempo.<sb>Además, el jugador puede lanzar el objeto abriendo la mano o soltando<sb>el gatillo en cualquier momento durante la acción.<sb>Esto hace que reconstruir el acto de arrojar un objeto virtual sea<sb>un problema de procesamiento<cr>de señales muy interesante.<sb>El software de realidad virtual debe identificar la intención del jugador<sb>a partir de la información analizada por el mando, y a lo largo de los años<sb>hemos aprendido mucho sobre<cr>qué funciona y qué no.<sb>En <I>The Lab<I>, que publicamos en 2016,<cr>analizamos la información<sb>posicional del mando cada 11 milisegundos y usamos las posiciones analizadas<sb>para calcular la velocidad del mando<cr>en cada intervalo.<sb>A continuación, usamos un promedio de la velocidad y dirección calculadas en varios<sb>fotogramas antes y después de que el objeto se lance para determinar<sb>la velocidad y la dirección<cr>que aplicar al objeto lanzado.<sb>Aunque esta opción era lo suficientemente funcional para emplearla,<cr>no siempre era consistente,<sb>sobre todo si la velocidad de fotogramas era inferior a 90 por segundo.<sb>Después, en <I>Moondust<I>, la demo técnica del mando Index, mejoramos<sb>este algoritmo centrándolo<cr>en datos de mayor velocidad.<sb>También ampliamos la interfaz de software de SteamVR para ofrecerle al mando<sb>una información de velocidad y aceleración instantáneas desde el hardware<sb>de unidad de medición inercial, que se calcula en el mando cada 2 milisegundos.<sb>De este modo, no teníamos que realizar una estimación desde las posiciones<sb>analizadas por el motor solo cada 11 milisegundos, como habíamos hecho con <I>The Lab<I>.<sb>Esto resultó fundamental para ofrecer mayor sensibilidad, ya que los cálculos<sb>de lanzamiento ya no estaban vinculados a la frecuencia de fotogramas de renderizado.<sb>Tras más pruebas, llegamos a la solución usada en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><sb>que utiliza diez imágenes previas al lanzamiento del objeto sujetado y<sb>promedia las tres imágenes que agrupan la velocidad máxima del mando<cr>en ese espacio de tiempo.<sb>Descubrimos que esto solía ofrecer una mejor aproximación de cuándo<sb>el jugador tenía la intención de soltar un objeto lanzado.<sb>Este método hizo que los lanzamientos fueran cómodos y consistentes, y nos permitió<sb>asegurarnos de que los jugadores podrían lanzar granadas o cualquier otro objeto con seguridad.
Esta conexión eléctrica opcional está pensada para que los jugadores aprendan<sb>a no tocar todas las intersecciones antes de saber lo que hacen.<sb>Este rompecabezas en especial se diseñó para que se active una alarma<sb>de incendios si el jugador se limita a tocar cada intersección<sb>que se encuentre sin mirar qué hay más adelante.<sb>Un jugador observador puede solucionar el rompecabezas fácilmente sin activar la alarma,<sb>pero alguien más descuidado la activará y provocará que un soldado de la Alianza<sb>aparezca por la esquina para averiguar qué es ese ruido.
Los jugadores suelen pasar hasta dos horas avanzando por los espacios interiores<sb>del Hotel Estrella del Norte. Durante las pruebas, descubrimos que<sb>solían tener problemas para recordar el siguiente objetivo: perturbar<sb>la subestación de la Alianza que hay arriba.<sb>En pruebas iniciales, la bóveda recordaba constantemente a los jugadores<sb>su presencia emitiendo un patrón musical abstracto.<sb><wait:18>Este llamaba la atención del jugador y la mantenía con tanta eficacia<sb>que lo ampliamos y desarrollamos como un patrón semimusical<sb>que cambiamos para emitir desde la subestación de la Alianza para representar<sb>cómo se reunía y transmitía energía de vortigaunt a la bóveda.<sb><wait:18>Desde dentro del hotel, el jugador no puede ver la subestación,<sb>así que repetimos este patrón sonoro con diferentes volúmenes en el hotel<sb>para recordarle la presencia de la subestación de la Alianza y la bóveda en el exterior.<sb><wait:10>De hecho, si observas detenidamente la vegetación de Xen cuando estás en el hotel,<sb>verás que reacciona visiblemente al exceso de energía de vortigaunt que fluye desde la subestación.
Teniendo en cuenta la gran cantidad de botellas que hay en este universo y que son<sb>un elemento tan significativo al jugar en la destilería, decidimos que<sb>la interacción con ellas fuese lo más interesante posible. Para ello, usamos un efecto<cr>de líquidos procedimental.<sb>A cada botella se le asigna un nivel de líquido aleatorio, y los valores de la agitación<sb>y la espuma que contiene la botella se calculan en función de su movimiento.<sb>Esto se almacena en el matiz de color del objeto que, de lo contrario, no tendría ningún uso.<sb>El sombreador calcula el nivel de líquido en función de la orientación de la botella en el juego.<sb>Como la cantidad de líquido visible en una botella en proporción a su altura<sb>varía cuando está boca arriba, de lado o boca abajo, se usan<sb>diferentes valores para preservar el aparente volumen del líquido que contiene.<sb>A continuación, la superficie del líquido se desplaza con una serie de sinusoides,<sb>moduladas con el valor de agitación para crear movimiento en ondas.<sb>Las zonas donde hay líquido y no aire<sb>usan los valores de índice de color y<cr>refracción de ese líquido.<sb>Los efectos de burbujas y espuma se añaden en función de los valores de agitación y espuma.<sb>Estos son procedimentales y se pueden modificar para crear varios comportamientos distintos.<sb>Se crean varias capas de burbujas en un espacio de visión local relativo<sb>al objeto, para que permanezcan estables<cr>entre fotogramas<sb>y siempre puedan moverse hacia arriba, respecto a la dirección de la gravedad.<sb>Los artistas pueden establecer varios parámetros por líquido, como el color, el brillo,<sb>el potencial de espuma, las propiedades de la onda y el menisco de la superficie del líquido,<sb>que se curva en los bordes<cr>del volumen para contribuir<sb>a transmitir su viscosidad.<sb>El entorno refractado que se ve a través del cristal y el líquido se analiza<sb>con el mismo mapa de entorno cúbico de la zona local empleada para los reflejos.<sb>De este modo, las botellas son opacas<cr>y no tienen que mezclarse<sb>con la memoria de fotograma<cr>como haría un objeto transparente.<sb>Fue una elección de diseño estratégica; además de almacenar la información física<sb>en el matiz de color, sirve para que las botellas se rendericen en conjunto,<sb>en un orden arbitrario, algo fundamental para el rendimiento gráfico.<sb>Al final, el efecto líquido refractivo permite que haya varias interacciones, con una fidelidad<sb>que lo hace especialmente interesante con los mandos de seguimiento de manos<sb>en realidad virtual.
Sabíamos por proyectos de RV anteriores que los jugadores esperarían una gran fidelidad<sb>de sus interacciones con los objetos del mundo y,<sb>durante las primeras fases de pruebas de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, nos llegaron comentarios<sb>que decían que los objetos no sonaban como esperaban los jugadores<sb>dado su material, su tamaño o su peso aparente.<sb>Esto nos hizo adoptar un enfoque mucho más detallista<sb>que en productos anteriores respecto a los sonidos físicos del juego.<sb>Por ejemplo, en el pasado habríamos usado un único sonido físico<sb>para todos los objetos de un material y tamaño concretos.<sb>Es decir, habría un sonido para representar la colisión de pequeños objetos metálicos,<sb>otro para objetos grandes de madera, etcétera.<sb>En <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, creamos una nueva biblioteca de sonidos de objetos<sb>específicos para poder distinguir incluso los que fueran similares,<sb>como una pieza de cubertería o una pequeña lata metálica.<sb>Ahora contamos con una biblioteca de casi dos mil sonidos físicos<sb>para 160 objetos distintos,<sb>además de la posibilidad de alterarlos sobre la marcha según la velocidad de colisión de un objeto<sb>y la dureza del material contra el que impacta.<sb>En ciertos casos , incluso añadimos los sonidos del contenido de un objeto,<sb>como las cerillas de una caja o el combustible de una lata, para que suenen<sb>cuando el jugador lo agita o cuando choca contra algo a gran velocidad.
Al entrar en la zona de cuarentena se descubre<cr>un nuevo secreto oculto de la ciudad:<sb>la vida vegetal extraterrestre de Xen<cr>se ha arraigado en la Tierra y está medrando<cr>entre las sombras de Ciudad 17.<sb>Entre el equipo de desarrollo,<cr>el Hotel Estrella del Norte se conocía como<sb>el "Hotel Xen" antes de que tuviera su propio nombre en la historia,<cr>ya que fue el primer<sb>lugar donde exploramos el aspecto<cr>que tendría la vegetación de Xen<sb>y cómo podría consumir cualquier entorno.<sb>Uno de los desafíos a los que se enfrentó el equipo responsable del entorno al diseñar<cr>la vegetación de Xen<sb>fue añadir un nuevo aspecto a un entorno existente<sb>sin tener que reconstruir las versiones invadidas por Xen de cada elemento.<sb>Empleamos muchas mezclas de texturas y reutilizamos muchos modelos de vegetación de Xen<sb>para efectuar la mayoría de los cambios<cr>al "xenificar" un entorno.<sb>También hemos añadido funciones nuevas a nuestro editor de niveles, Hammer,<cr>lo que nos permitió<sb>una mayor manipulación creativa de los recursos para reducir las repeticiones.<sb>Por ejemplo, agregamos tipos de mallas específicos, como los tentáculos de Xen.<sb>Estos se podían colocar, agrandar o reducir, estirar y manipular para que se adaptaran a un entorno<sb>y otorgarle una sensación realista sin tener que diseñar cada recurso individual<cr>para una ubicación específica.<sb>Estos elementos se podían editar en Hammer, por lo que se podían ajustar en cualquier momento,<sb>aunque al compilar el mapa se integraban en mallas estáticas para mejorar el rendimiento<cr>del tiempo de ejecución.
La flora de Xen de esta zona se anima en respuesta a la energía de vortigaunt<sb>proveniente de la subestación<cr>de la Alianza que hay fuera.<sb>Como no puede verse la subestación desde el interior del hotel,<sb>era importante seguir recordándoles a los jugadores su presencia mediante pistas<sb>acústicas y visuales, y la flora de Xen nos dio la oportunidad perfecta para lograr este efecto.<sb>Los sombreadores usados en la flora de Xen sirven para ilustrar<sb>la respuesta de las plantas a los latidos de energía de varias maneras.<sb>Por ejemplo, las vellosidades y cilios<cr>se alargan y vibran,<sb>y las demás plantas laten o brillan.<sb>La intensidad y la forma de estos efectos las determina directamente el sistema de sonido,<sb>por lo que los refuerzos acústico y visual de los latidos de la subestación de la Alianza siempre están sincronizados.
El Revividor, uno de los nuevos enemigos<cr>de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>,<sb>surgió al observar como los jugadores de pruebas disfrutaban explorando<sb>su entorno en realidad virtual mucho más que en juegos tradicionales.<sb>Además de recompensar esa ansia de exploración con munición y resina,<sb>quisimos probar a integrar eso en los enfrentamientos con enemigos.<sb>Comenzamos con el prototipo de una variante de cangrejo más veloz al que llamamos Corredor,<sb>alterando su comportamiento para que huyera del jugador y se escondiera tras sufrir un ataque.<sb>Descubrimos que a los jugadores<cr>les encantaba buscar<sb>un enemigo pequeño escondido<cr>en un entorno denso.<sb>También les gustaba disparar a un enemigo que se moviera rápidamente y pudiera<sb>correr y ocultarse detrás y debajo de objetos comunes, como mesas y sillas.<sb>Por último, los jugadores mencionaron que les gustó tener la opción de jugar un papel ofensivo<sb>en un combate, ya que en el resto del juego tenían la impresión de estar defendiéndose constantemente.<sb>Aunque, en general, la idea tuvo una buena acogida, había un problema concreto:<sb>debíamos averiguar cómo animar a los jugadores a buscar al Corredor.<sb>Tras un par de encuentros con el Corredor, los jugadores se daban cuenta de que<cr>no hacía falta buscarlo:<sb>bastaba con esperar a que saliera huyendo y después abandonar la sala. Por eso, buscamos la forma de hacer que el Corredor se volviera<sb>más peligroso si no se encontraba, lo que presionaba a los jugadores a encontrar<sb>al Corredor rápidamente para que<cr>no empeorara la situación.<sb>Tras unas cuantas pruebas, obtuvimos el prototipo en el que el Corredor podía<sb>resucitar a un zombi muerto y así convertirse en un nuevo oponente,<sb>más peligroso que un Corredor o un zombi.<sb>Tras esta modificación, decidimos cambiar el nombre del Corredor a Revividor,<sb>y empezamos a organizar los diferentes encuentros.<sb>Tuvimos que realizar muchas pruebas para equilibrar los diferentes elementos de los combates<sb>con Revividores porque había varias fases bien diferenciadas:<sb>el combate contra un Revividor, buscar a un Revividor escondido y el combate contra un Revividor zombi.<sb>Al final, no teníamos la sensación de ofrecer un motivo suficiente para que<sb>los jugadores buscaran a los Revividores escondidos, así que convertimos<sb>el corazón del Revividor en una llave,<sb>para que los jugadores tuvieran que conseguirla.
La animación de un enemigo puede desencadenar una respuesta emocional muy poderosa en los jugadores, sobre todo en realidad virtual.<sb>Mientras desarrollábamos al Revividor, descubrimos que, en ocasiones, la actitud<sb>de un personaje puede tener<cr>consecuencias no planeadas.<sb>Con los primeros prototipos del Revividor nos limitamos a usar un modelo<sb>de cangrejo azul con<cr>efectos eléctricos rudimentarios.<sb>El prototipo funcionó bien durante las pruebas, así que decidimos crear<sb>un nuevo modelo específico de Revividor, con piel eléctrica y efectos mejorados.<sb>Los jugadores lograron identificar al nuevo Revividor en el juego, pero nos encontramos con un problema nuevo:<sb>ya no querían enfrentarse a él.<sb>Aunque era fácil identificar al cangrejo azul como un elemento peligroso,<sb>los jugadores tenían que examinar a este nuevo modelo como a un elemento nuevo,<sb>y no lo veían necesariamente como una amenaza.<sb>De hecho, a muchos jugadores les pareció que las animaciones creadas<cr>para el nuevo modelo de Revividor<sb>le daban un toque amistoso e incluso adorable.<sb>A menudo, los jugadores se acercaban a la criatura para intentar acariciarla o, peor aún,<sb>se negaban a matarla para conseguir la pieza del rompecabezas necesaria, lo que impedía su progreso en el juego.<sb>Si se daban cuenta de que tenían que matar<cr>a esa criatura tan adorable<sb>para poder continuar, se sentían fatal haciéndolo.<sb>Para resolver este problema, modificamos la mayoría de las animaciones del Revividor<sb>para que resultase más inquietante y amenazador.<sb>También hicimos que el Revividor fuera más agresivo: si el jugador se acercaba demasiado, la criatura se abalanzaría sobre él.<sb>Con estos cambios de animación y comportamiento, los jugadores ya se enfrentaban<sb>al Revividor como debían y ya no querían convertirlo en su mascota.
Esta es la sala que aparece en el primer plano del tráiler publicitario de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>No parece una elección obvia: es una sala oscura, sin mucha gama cromática<sb>y el pasillo es bastante común.<sb>Los artículos de limpieza y los cestos de la colada tampoco son especialmente atractivos.<sb>Sin embargo, optamos por este escenario porque consigue captar<sb>la emoción y la tensión que son características del juego, en nuestra opinión.<sb>Todos los tráileres de juegos requieren un diseño meticuloso.<sb>Transmitir la experiencia principal de un juego en unos pocos momentos resulta complejo,<cr>cuando menos.<sb>Para nosotros, el tráiler de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> requería un esfuerzo superior al habitual<sb>para estar a la altura de una serie de retos especialmente complicados e inusuales.<sb>Debíamos mantener en secreto la existencia del juego, y este tráiler era<sb>la primera vez en 13 años que Valve mostraría cualquier tipo de elemento del universo <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>No solo eso: el tráiler tenía que comunicar rápidamente que Valve había decidido<sb>que el próximo título de <I>Half-Life<I> sería un juego de realidad virtual.<sb>Y, aunque estábamos satisfechos con la decisión de haber creado un juego en realidad virtual<sb>y con la calidad de lo que habíamos creado,<cr>seguía preocupándonos<sb>compartirlo con el mundo y que hasta los seguidores más acérrimos<sb>pensaran que habíamos perdido el norte.<sb>Quienes trabajamos en el tráiler sabíamos que debía impactar y emocionar<sb>tanto a la gente como para dejar a un lado las posibles preocupaciones.<sb>Además, el tráiler debía dejar claro que el juego <I>no<I> era Half-Life 3.<sb>Es decir, no hablaría de los eventos posteriores al Episodio 2.<sb>En lugar de eso, <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> era<cr>una especie de precuela<sb>que tenía lugar entre los sucesos<cr>de <I>Half-Life<I> y <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Además, el tráiler debía mostrar profundidad, variedad, personajes conocidos<sb>y suficientes novedades y sorpresas como para transmitir al público que era<sb>un título de pleno derecho dentro de la saga<cr><I>Half-Life<I> y no un experimento en realidad virtual<cr>ni un producto derivado.<sb>Esto supuso todo un reto, pero todos los miembros del equipo aportaron<sb>su granito de arena porque todos comprendíamos el valor de este trabajo.<sb>Estamos tan orgullosos del resultado<cr>logrado con el tráiler<sb>como de cualquier otro elemento de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.
<I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> cuenta con tres tipos de movimiento para los jugadores.<sb>Movimiento continuo, desplazamiento y teletransporte.<sb>Al principio, una de las propiedades del teletransporte y, en menor medida,<sb>del desplazamiento, fue que los jugadores<cr>se referían a la mecánica<sb>de teletransportarse para describir<cr>el acto de recorrer el entorno.<sb>Los jugadores usaban expresiones como<cr>"Me he teletransportado hasta el escritorio" o <cr>"Me he teletransportado para ponerme a cubierto"<sb>para describir sus acciones, y esto era<cr>un recordatorio inconsciente<sb>de que estaban interactuando<cr>con el juego de un modo determinado.<sb>Para abordar este problema, hicimos una serie de cambios esenciales al principio que alteraron<sb>considerablemente la forma en la que los jugadores describían la forma en la que se movían.<cr>Como resultado,<sb>empezaron a experimentar la realidad virtual<cr>de una forma más convincente.<sb>Uno de estos cambios fue el indicador visual que representaba el destino del teletransporte.<sb>Intercambiamos el indicador cilíndrico abstracto<cr>que se usaba en <I>The Lab<I><cr>con un par de pies holográficos.<sb>Los pies ayudan a proporcionar una sensación<cr>de presencia física e indican<sb>la dirección en la que miraría el jugador tras terminar de teletransportarse.<sb>También incluimos una animación de pies entre la ubicación actual del jugador y el destino<cr>del teletransporte.<sb>Estos pies representaban el camino<cr>que recorrería el jugador,<sb>lo que contribuye a crear la impresión<cr>de que se desplaza por el entorno.<sb>Además de los cambios en la interfaz visual, también añadimos sonidos de pisadas<sb>y movimientos corporales que se reproducen después de teletransportarse,<sb>para reflejar el movimiento del jugador<cr>por el espacio.<sb>No todo el mundo se percata de inmediato de esto,<sb>pero si falta o si no es correcto,<cr>es muy fácil de detectar.<sb>El sonido de las pisadas transformó la forma en la que los jugadores describían sus movimientos<sb>por el mundo, y estos se referían a dicho movimiento en el entorno<sb>como "caminar" o "correr", en lugar de emplear terminología típica de los juegos.
En comparación con nuestras clásicas experiencias en primera persona, descubrimos que,<sb>a veces, es muy fácil crear una atmósfera intensa en realidad virtual.<sb>Puede utilizarse para beneficio del juego, pero también puede resultar negativo<sb>en casos en los que queremos centrarnos en enseñar una mecánica nueva a los jugadores.<sb>En situaciones intensas, los jugadores no suelen darse cuenta de información fundamental,<cr>o no la recuerdan.<sb>Como resultado, a menudo teníamos que reducir intencionadamente la tensión<sb>de zonas del juego donde presentábamos un elemento nuevo a los jugadores.<sb>El audio del Revividor en este momento, cuando el jugador desciende por debajo del hotel,<sb>se diseñó para introducir sutilmente la idea de que se iba a enfrentar<sb>a la criatura que había visto fugazmente antes de entrar en el edificio.<sb>El chillido del Revividor y su sombra en la pared se han diseñado para reducir<sb>la tensión, ya que indican la posición de esta criatura a la vuelta de la esquina.<cr>Esto elimina el efecto sorpresa.<sb>Comunicar la posición del Revividor y ofrecer una ventaja a los jugadores<sb>sirve para preparar la escena de la resurrección, en la que los jugadores prefieren observar<sb>al Revividor en lugar de dispararle automáticamente.<sb>Esto es algo fundamental; es la primera vez<cr>que el jugador ve<sb>al Revividor resucitando a un zombi, y si se distrae demasiado para asimilarlo,<sb>no tendrá muchas posibilidades de superar<cr>el próximo combate.
Uno de los desafíos de la mecánica de resurrección del Revividor fue hacer entender<sb>a los jugadores que este era el blanco,<cr>y que el zombi<sb>solo era un medio de transporte inerte<cr>que no podía sufrir daños.<sb>Esto se alejaba considerablemente de las expectativas que habíamos creado<cr>a los jugadores en el pasado.<sb>Hasta este momento, los jugadores veían un zombi,<sb>le disparaban y, si lo alcanzaban el número suficiente de veces, se moría.<sb>El Revividor destruye esta expectativa. En las pruebas iniciales, los jugadores pensaban<sb>que el juego tenía algún error porque el zombi no se moría ni reaccionaba cuando le disparaban.<sb>Tuvimos que realizar una serie de cambios en los zombis resucitados para que los jugadores entendieran que esto era algo intencionado.<sb>Primero, diseñamos la animación de presentación del zombi resucitado con sonidos y efectos<sb>de partículas para dirigir la atención hacia estos cambios, cuya consecuencia era<cr>este nuevo tipo de combate.<sb>Después, empleamos sonidos de impactos y partículas sordos para que disparar<sb>al zombi no causase la misma impresión que los encuentros previos con zombis que no resucitaban.<sb>Por último, modificamos al zombi resucitado<cr>para que no tuviera<sb>ninguna animación de estremecimiento ni reaccionara a los balazos, comunicando así<sb>que su actitud es diferente.<sb>También utilizamos al Revividor para reflejar esta nueva experiencia de combate.<sb>Se añadieron efectos eléctricos para indicar el movimiento del Revividor dentro<sb>del zombi, con un destello brillante y un sonido mientras salía de una nueva parte<cr>del cuerpo del zombi.<sb>Con estos gráficos nuevos, los satisfactorios sonidos de impacto y los chillidos del Revividor al recibir impactos,<sb>los jugadores de pruebas ya no se confundían y disfrutaban de esta nueva mecánica de combate.
En los primeros diseños que realizamos, un zombi resucitado no era más<sb>que un zombi invencible con un punto débil móvil.<sb>Las pruebas indicaron que esto no resultaba tan tenso ni amenazante como el Revividor<sb>por sí solo. Como queríamos que el zombi resucitado fuese un rival imponente,<sb>debíamos reforzar su destreza ofensiva.<sb>Como extensión lógica de la naturaleza electrificada del Revividor,<sb>optamos por crear un campo eléctrico alrededor del zombi resucitado<sb>para que los jugadores que se acercasen demasiado quedaran electrocutados.<sb>Esto funcionó bastante bien en muchas pruebas, hasta que observamos<sb>a un jugador que era un gran tirador en la vida real.<sb>Este jugador podía liquidar sin ningún problema<cr>al zombi resucitado,<sb>sin llegar a considerarlo una amenaza.<sb>Para solucionar esto, le dimos un contraataque eléctrico al zombi resucitado<sb>que obliga a los jugadores a cambiar de posición para evitar sufrir daños.<sb>Así, creamos una cadencia de ataque y retirada más tensa y satisfactoria para todos los jugadores.
Como los juegos de realidad virtual siempre se reproducen desde una cámara virtual que coincide<sb>con el ángulo de visión del jugador, las oportunidades de controlar lo que ve son limitadas.<sb>Los ascensores son una de las pocas herramientas que tenemos en realidad virtual para dirigir el ángulo de visión del jugador.<sb>Un ascensor que sube, como este, puede usarse de forma similar a un plano aéreo<sb>como los de las películas, que va<cr>de una elevación a otra<sb>y muestra una panorámica espectacular o un momento álgido en la historia.<sb>En la realidad virtual, puede ser difícil lograr que un ascensor resulte cómodo,<sb>ya que su movimiento no coincide con el sistema vestibular del jugador.<sb>Hemos descubierto que podemos hacer que los ascensores de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><cr>sean suficientemente cómodos<sb>para la mayoría de los jugadores si hacemos que se muevan lentamente y limitamos<sb>el espacio exterior que puede verse desde dentro.<sb>Este ascensor en particular estaba mucho más abierto inicialmente, pero poco a poco<sb>añadimos más obstrucciones visuales al diseño para que el jugador<sb>siempre tenga en su ángulo de visión una parte considerable del ascensor.<sb>Así logramos representar de forma dramática la revelación del exterior del hotel<sb>y de la subestación de la Alianza, tal y como queríamos. Y los jugadores<sb>se sentían cómodos, pues veían en todo momento el ascensor, su propio marco de referencia.
Tras salir del ascensor, el jugador se encuentra con el plano más cercano<sb>de la subestación de la Alianza<cr>junto al exterior del hotel.<sb>Aunque la arquitectura de la Alianza puede resultar un tanto abstracta, a menudo<sb>funciona mejor cuando se compara con una estructura humana.<sb>Aparte de esto, siempre queremos impulsar el diseño visual con una función inventada,<sb>idealmente con el fin de reforzar la jugabilidad o la historia; en este caso, la transmisión<sb>de una fuente de energía poco común desde varias partes de la ciudad hasta la bóveda.<sb>El jugador todavía no lo sabe, pero esta subestación se ha diseñado<sb>básicamente para torturar a un grupo de vortigaunts encerrados en las granjas de cápsulas.<sb>"Se extrae su canción y un único vortigaunt director" la "rearmoniza"<sb>mediante el artefacto afinador de cables<cr>que se ve donde empiezan<sb>los cables de transmisión<cr>que llevan hasta la bóveda.<sb>Este diseño nos dio la oportunidad de conocer posteriormente a otro vortigaunt<sb>y fue una especie de limitación<cr>que nos permitió crear una interacción<sb>que pusiera en peligro físico la subestación mientras el jugador sale del hotel<cr>en el siguiente mapa.
La vegetación de Xen se ha diseñado para que responda de varias maneras al jugador.<sb>En las zonas oscuras, donde la linterna está encendida, parte de la flora<sb>de Xen reacciona a la luz y se anima o extiende.<sb>Estas plantas de Xen responden latiendo y brillando cuando el jugador acerca la mano.<sb>El brillo en particular se consigue con una discrepancia; usa<sb>la perspectiva binocular adecuada para cada ojo,<cr>lo que da la impresión<sb>de que el brillo proviene del interior del organismo.<sb>Los efectos de sombreado de la flora de Xen, que dependen de la proximidad de la mano,<sb>reaccionan gracias a un campo dinámico de vóxeles que sigue al jugador constantemente.<sb>Las manos del jugador producen movimientos en este campo de vóxeles,<sb>y los sombreadores de la vegetación los utilizan para crear alteraciones y otros efectos de sombra.<sb>Si el jugador mueve las manos rápidamente, crea un rastro de movimiento en el campo de vóxeles.<sb>Si deja las manos quietas, irradian fuerza.<sb>Estos tipos de movimiento distintos<cr>nos permiten crear<sb>varias reacciones de la vegetación, para así conferirle un poco de personalidad.
Los efectos de partículas ofrecen un interesante desafío en realidad virtual debido a la estereopsis,<sb>que es la capacidad de distinguir la profundidad de los objetos desde los dos ángulos del mundo<sb>ligeramente distintos que percibimos con cada ojo.<sb>Los sistemas de partículas tradicionales, como vemos a la izquierda, se solían<sb>implementar como una serie de imágenes de un libro de animación colocadas sobre<sb>polígonos relativamente grandes que se orientan hacia el jugador.<sb>Cada serie de imágenes contenía una pequeña película de un fenómeno<sb>más complejo, como una nube de humo flotando, una llama parpadeante, etcétera.<sb>Para el renderizado monoscópico que se usa en sistemas ajenos a la realidad virtual, este método<sb>funciona bastante bien y es popular en el sector.<sb>Sin embargo, el renderizado estereoscópico que se usa en realidad virtual hace<cr>que los jugadores detecten<sb>con facilidad los planos simples. El resultado es el efecto poco convincente que se ve a la izquierda.<sb>Para abordar este problema, tuvimos que actualizar las técnicas de renderizado de partículas<cr>para la realidad virtual.<sb>El sistema de partículas de la derecha es una versión actualizada del efecto de la izquierda, compatible con la realidad virtual.<sb>Una técnica que empleamos en los planos grandes, como los utilizados para este efecto de humo,<sb>fue limitar la reacción de los planos al movimiento de la cabeza del jugador.<sb>Para ello, creamos otro sistema de partículas que ralentizaba la posición del jugador<sb>y se utilizaba como la cámara del jugador al determinar la dirección de los planos de humo.<sb>Al eliminar esta relación unívoca entre el movimiento de la cabeza<sb>y la rotación del efecto, logramos que diera la impresión de que el humo tenía volumen.<sb>Además de añadir más elementos en 3D al crear los efectos,<sb>también usamos una tecnología de posprocesamiento en las partículas para favorecer<sb>la combinación visual de elementos que, de lo contrario, se verían como<cr>un conjunto de imágenes planas.<sb>Esto dificultaba que los planos se combinaran con la estereopsis, lo cual les dio una sensación<cr>más difusa y voluminosa.
Uno de los pilares del diseño en <I>Half-Life<I><cr>es diseñar meticulosamente<sb>experiencias constantes en las que participan los jugadores mientras avanzan en el juego.<sb>A veces, esto significa jugar con las respuestas emocionales para transformar<sb>algo desagradable en un momento memorable.<sb>Esta parte derrumbada del hotel ofrece<cr>este tipo de experiencia.<sb>Los jugadores suelen sentirse atraídos instintivamente hacia el lugar<cr>que parezca más seguro<sb>en una zona concreta, que aquí sería el pasillo bien iluminado de la parte superior.<sb>Sin embargo, una vez allí, descubren que el camino está bloqueado por un escudo<cr>de energía de la Alianza.<sb>El cable eléctrico que desactiva el campo de fuerza de la Alianza los lleva de vuelta<sb>a la oscuridad infestada de cangrejos venenosos.<sb>Y, desde luego, por ahí no querían pasar.<sb>Estos espacios de mayor tamaño también deben funcionar con independencia<cr>de lo que escoja el jugador.<sb>Es decir, aunque un jugador decida no ir al pasillo bien iluminado,<sb>probablemente sentirá la misma inquietud al adentrarse en la oscuridad de la zona inferior.<sb>Después de que el jugador haya hecho frente a la oscuridad y se haya refugiado<sb>en la sala iluminada, a salvo de cangrejos, deberá<sb>cortar la energía del campo de fuerza de la Alianza, una tarea desalentadora,<sb>ya que tiene el efecto colateral de sumir esa zona en las tinieblas.<sb>Esto empeora la situación, no solo porque<cr>el jugador debe salir<sb>de esa oscuridad absoluta sirviéndose<cr>solo de una linterna,<sb>sino también porque el camino de salida está repleto de cangrejos venenosos.<sb>Hemos pasado mucho tiempo optimizando esta experiencia con pruebas<cr>y evaluaciones meticulosas.<sb>A menudo, cuando los jugadores recordaban<cr>el recorrido por el hotel<sb>tras finalizar las pruebas, el momento de sumirse en una oscuridad total<sb>les parecía una situación apoteósica que combinaba entretenimiento y<cr>una sensación de terror.
Un problema común a la hora de diseñar un juego es la distribución de recursos,<sb>y esta parte del juego es un buen ejemplo.<sb>Los jugadores acaban de salir de una zona donde han conseguido el subfusil de la Alianza.<sb>Siempre que obtiene un arma nueva,<cr>intentamos darle al jugador<sb>la oportunidad de experimentar<cr>con ella de inmediato.<sb>Justo después de conseguir el subfusil, nos aseguramos de que el jugador tuviera mucha munición para esta arma<sb>y suficientes enemigos poco peligrosos<cr>con los que practicar,<sb>como zombis confinados y cangrejos.<sb>No obstante, las pruebas nos han enseñado que los jugadores pueden responder<sb>ante la misma situación de maneras muy diferentes.<sb>Hay quien dispara un cangrejo o dos y decide avanzar; otros se toman su tiempo<sb>explorando el arma e incluso gastan toda la munición que les hemos dado.<sb>Justo después de los cangrejos, el jugador se dirige a una zona nueva<sb>donde tiene lugar uno de los combates<cr>más duros del juego,<sb>en el que deberá enfrentarse a dos Revividores<cr>al mismo tiempo.<sb>¿Cuánta munición debería tener aquí el jugador?<sb>¿Cuánta deberíamos incluir en este lugar, situada entre las dos zonas, para asegurarnos de que<sb>todos los jugadores tienen suficiente para enfrentarse a los dos Revividores? Si no ofrecemos una cantidad suficiente,<sb>al jugador podría resultarle imposible sobrevivir al próximo encuentro,<sb>incluso cargando la partida guardada.<sb>Tendrían que volver atrás y repetir la zona anterior,<sb>pero esta vez ahorrando más munición.<sb>No queremos que los jugadores<cr>se vean en esa situación,<sb>ni podemos esperar que todos<cr>se den cuenta del problema.<sb>Muchos intentarían liquidar a los dos Revividores una y otra vez sin poder lograrlo.<sb>El problema principal de la distribución de recursos es que la cantidad<sb>que puede llevar los jugadores puede ser considerable y aumenta conforme avanza el juego.<sb>En <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, hemos visto como algunos usuarios terminaban el juego<sb>casi sin munición, mientras que otros tenían más de mil cartuchos sin usar.
¿Cómo podemos gestionar la distribución de recursos cuando hay un margen dinámico<sb>tan amplio en los patrones de recogida<cr>y uso de los jugadores?<sb>Al igual que sucede con muchos juegos, hemos optado por un sistema dinámico<cr>que toma decisiones<sb>en función de los recursos actuales del jugador.<sb>Pero el diseño de este tipo de sistemas<cr>puede ser complejo,<sb>porque suelen afectar a la actitud del jugador.<sb>Por ejemplo, en <I>Half-Life 2<I> colocamos por todo el juego cajas que se podían romper<sb>y generaban recursos de forma dinámica en función de la salud y la munición que tuviera el jugador.<sb>Gracias a esto, no necesitábamos una gran cantidad de pruebas<sb>para equilibrar los recursos, puesto que,<cr>siempre que hubiera<sb>suficientes cajas, el jugador siempre tendría recursos suficientes.<sb>Sin embargo, debido a ese sistema, no tuvimos que dedicar mucho tiempo<sb>a distribuir recursos.<sb>Como resultado, no creamos desafíos<cr>relacionados con la recolección de recursos.<sb>Además, los jugadores descubrieron que no tenían que preocuparse por los niveles<sb>de sus recursos, porque las cajas siempre les proporcionarían lo que más necesitaran.<sb>En el caso de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, tratamos de reexaminar estas suposiciones.<sb>Sabíamos que buscar recursos en un entorno de realidad virtual era una de<cr>las partes favoritas de los jugadores.<sb>Por lo tanto, queríamos que tuvieran que conseguir recursos a lo largo de todo el juego.<sb>Es decir, no queríamos que llegara un momento en el que tuvieran<sb>tanta munición y salud que no sintieran la necesidad de explorar.<sb>También comenzamos con las pruebas en una fase del ciclo de desarrollo del producto<sb>anterior a la de cuando creamos <I>Half-Life 2<I>, lo cual nos dio la seguridad<sb>de que tendríamos tiempo suficiente para planear cuidadosamente dónde colocar cada recurso.
En el caso de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>, pasamos a un sistema que nos permitió crear<sb>una experiencia más específica mediante una capa dinámica que trata<sb>de reducir la diferencia de recolección de recursos entre jugadores.
<sb>En lugar de colocar recursos genéricos cuyo tipo cambia, los diseñadores de niveles<sb>distribuyeron cuidadosamente todo tipo de recursos por el mundo.<sb>Algunos son fáciles de encontrar y otros, no tanto.<sb>A medida que el jugador avanza por el mundo, el sistema analiza los recursos<sb>de los que dispone y, si hace falta, elimina los que se encuentran más adelante.<sb>Gracias a esto, los diseñadores de niveles disponían de un gran control<sb>sobre las cantidades de recursos del jugador en distintas zonas del juego.<sb>De este modo, podían crear áreas donde querían que al jugador<sb>le faltase un tipo de munición concreto o le animaban a usar otro.<sb>Por ejemplo, en esta zona los diseñadores colocaron suficiente munición para asegurarse<sb>de que el jugador tendría suficiente para enfrentarse a dos Revividores, sabiendo que<sb>el sistema de equilibrio de munición eliminaría gran parte de ella si el jugador ya tenía bastante.<sb>Podíamos darles a los jugadores una gran cantidad de munición para el subfusil de la Alianza<cr>en la zona anterior,<sb>y saber que los que habían dejado atrás los cangrejos venenosos sin disparar una sola vez no encontrarían munición aquí.<sb>Existen varias características adicionales para abordar las complejidades derivadas<sb>de este sistema, como asegurarnos de que los jugadores siempre encuentran algo<sb>dentro de los casilleros de la Alianza o que siguen recibiendo recompensas<sb>por explorar frecuentemente y de forma meticulosa, aunque tengan mucha munición.<sb>Al final, queremos que los jugadores que prestan más atención al entorno<cr>dispongan de más recursos.<sb>Solo necesitábamos un sistema para limitar la ventaja que puede llegar a lograr.
Hasta este momento, todos los encuentros con Revividores se habían centrado en explicarles<sb>a los jugadores algo nuevo sobre estas criaturas para que pudieran derrotarlas.<sb>Esta área representa la culminación de todas nuestras explicaciones.<sb>No hay nuevas reglas.<sb>No hay nada nuevo que aprender del Revividor.<sb>Llegados a este punto, los jugadores poseen el conocimiento necesario para avanzar.<sb>Entonces, el desafío se convierte en un problema de combate que requiere estrategia y ejecución.<sb>Los jugadores tendrán que alternar entre varios blancos y priorizar unos sobre otros, hacer uso<sb>de todas sus armas y gestionar una munición limitada para sobrevivir<sb>y abrirse camino hasta el exterior del hotel para desactivar la subestación de la Alianza.
Una de las tramas secundarias principales de la historia está relacionada<sb>con la reclusión y el uso de los vortigaunts por parte de la Alianza para atrapar a G-man.<sb>Usar el poder multidimensional de los vortigaunts para detener al aparentemente invencible<sb>G-man es algo que ya se había mencionado<cr>en <I>Half-Life<I> anteriores.<sb>Mediante el uso de cápsulas de prisioneros y tecnología de la subestación,<sb>la Alianza extrae el poder del canto<cr>de vortesencia de los vortigaunts,<sb>afina esa energía y después la transmite a la bóveda para contener a G-man.<sb>Para comunicarle al jugador<cr>este proceso de la Alianza<sb>sin una explicación tediosa, usamos patrones de sonidos musicales<sb>que representan este proceso de forma implícita.<sb>Si te colocas junto a las cápsulas<cr>donde están los vortigaunts,<sb>puedes oír como musitan su canto lentamente,<cr>pero con cierta melodía.<sb><wait:9>Después de las cápsulas verás el "resonador",<cr>y en su interior se oye<sb>una versión destilada de la energía de ese canto.<sb><wait:16>Por último, los cables se activan con la energía concentrada de vortigaunt,<sb>que se armoniza con varios patrones<cr>y se transmite intermitentemente<sb>a la bóveda en cuanto la energía está<cr>lo suficientemente afinada.<sb>Si te colocas junto a los cables<cr>mientras se están afinando, te percatarás<sb>del volumen y la capacidad del sonido.<sb>Esto se consiguió colocando los emisores<cr>de sonido de cada cable en<sb>las ubicaciones donde están los propios cables.<sb>El sonido de los cables abarca<cr>un gran rango de frecuencia que resalta<sb>el procesamiento de la función de transferencia relacionada con la cabeza de Steam Audio.<sb>Esta simulación, combinada con la reacción del oído interno de los observadores mientras<sb>miran hacia arriba, da la misma impresión dimensional que la realidad virtual<cr>confiere a los objetos visuales.<sb><wait:17>
La actuación de los personajes de un juego en realidad virtual presenta un conjunto de oportunidades y desafíos únicos.<sb>Con el fin de que el jugador siempre tenga el control, debemos crear actuaciones<sb>lo suficientemente interesantes como para mantener la atención,<sb>pero también flexibles para ofrecer<cr>la mayor libertad posible.<sb>Esta escena tiene la mayor interacción cara a cara del juego, y no hay ninguna<sb>barrera física entre el jugador y el vortigaunt la primera vez que este aparece.<sb>En un momento dado, nos planteamos la idea de insertar un susto cuando se libera al vortigaunt,<sb>alterando las expectativas de<cr>lo que el jugador pensaba<sb>que era solo una batería.<sb>No solo resultó ser algo torpe, sino que el vortigaunt salía de la cápsula<sb>sacudiéndose y solía acabar en el mismo espacio que ocupaba el jugador.<sb>Para resolver este problema, omitimos el susto y apartamos la cápsula del espacio<sb>del jugador cuando se abría para que el vortigaunt<sb>saliera desde una distancia cómoda.<sb>Nos enfrentamos a un desafío similar cuando pensamos en cómo hacer que el jugador<sb>y el vortigaunt llegasen a sus respectivas ubicaciones sin cruzarse.<sb>Queríamos que el jugador y el vortigaunt contemplaran el panorama juntos,<sb>y que el segundo ofreciera una explicación crucial.<sb>Habría sido extraño que el jugador<cr>y el vortigaunt tomasen<sb>la misma ruta por la pasarela, así que contemplamos otras opciones,<sb>como explorar la forma en la que el vortigaunt se habría movido en su entorno natural.<sb>Los vortigaunts tienen unos brazos largos, por lo que pueden moverse<sb>como cuadrúpedos.<cr>Por este motivo, optamos por que trepara ágilmente<sb>hasta la plataforma superior, donde podría dar su explicación sin ocupar el espacio del jugador.
Mientras desarrollábamos <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>,<cr>muchos especialistas de varias disciplinas<sb>contribuyeron con una serie de mapas relativamente pequeños.<sb>Por lo tanto, a menudo había varias personas trabajando en el mismo mapa a la vez.<sb>Una forma de gestionar esta complejidad<cr>fue dividir los mapas<sb>en partes más pequeñas o "prefabricados".<sb>Estos podían crearse con los mismos<cr>tipos de geometría, lógica,<sb>enemigos, sistemas de partículas u otros elementos de un mapa común.<sb>Siempre y cuando la gente trabajara en prefabricados distintos, se podrían<sb>realizar cambios o añadir elementos sin afectar<cr>al trabajo de los demás.<sb>Un prefabricado podía tener<cr>un espacio físico considerable,<sb>como este escenario callejero, o<cr>solo un puñado de elementos.<sb>Los prefabricados más grandes que dividían<cr>un mapa para favorecer la colaboración<sb>eran esenciales para un proyecto de esta envergadura, pero también<cr>se crearon muchos prefabricados pequeños<sb>y reutilizables para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Un buen ejemplo es el conjunto de prefabricados de vehículos reutilizables empleados<cr>aquí y por todo el juego.<sb>Cada vehículo se creó como<cr>un prefabricado configurable,<sb>lo que permitía a los diseñadores insertarlos rápidamente en el juego,<sb>personalizando varios parámetros<cr>según el contexto.<sb>Esos parámetros incluyen cosas como<cr>el color del vehículo, la cantidad<sb>de daño preexistente, si las puertas estaban abiertas o no había<sb>y el tipo de munición u otros recursos<cr>que podría tener el vehículo.<sb>Esto aceleró el ritmo de trabajo, lo que permitió que las actualizaciones de un prefabricado<sb>se propagaran automáticamente<cr>a todos los mapas que los utilizaban.
Las lonas que emplea la Alianza para tapar<cr>los edificios de la zona<sb>de cuarentena se han animado<cr>de manera procedimental.<sb>Esta animación se añadió relativamente tarde durante la fase de desarrollo,<cr>por lo que tenía que<sb>ser computacionalmente asequible y tecnológicamente conservadora.<sb>Es decir, nada de sistemas nuevos.<sb>Desplazamos la geometría<cr>de las partes de las lonas que<sb>cuelgan mediante ondulaciones superpuestas.<sb>La dirección de los desplazamientos<cr>depende del viento<sb>y las gradientes de una textura a la que llamamos<sb>"mapa de movimiento libre" determinan<cr>la dirección de su propagación.<sb>Este mapa se obtiene a partir de<cr>la forma geométrica del edificio cubierto<sb>y sirve para atenuar el desplazamiento,<cr>de forma que la lona no se mueva<sb>en lugares donde debe estar más pegada al edificio.<sb>El resultado es una lona ondeante<cr>que se adapta al entorno<sb>y se mueve en función del viento que sople.
El soldado de la Alianza que ves aquí<cr>no va a atacarte.<sb>Está programado para moverse de un lado a otro por el camino marcado en el suelo<sb>para ilustrar el sistema de redirección de paso desarrollado para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Uno de los desafíos a la hora de animar personajes digitales es asegurarse<sb>de que sus pies no se deslizan<cr>por el suelo cuando se mueven.<sb>A los humanos se nos da bien detectar irregularidades en los movimientos<cr>de personajes digitales,<sb>sobre todo en realidad virtual. En especial, en el caso de los soldados de la Alianza debe parecer<sb>que sus pies se plantan en el suelo y que su peso se desplaza al cambiar de dirección.<sb>De lo contrario, daría la impresión de que son seres ingrávidos, y no resultarían convincentes.<sb>En una fase de procesamiento previo, nuestro sistema de redirección de paso<cr>analiza los movimientos<sb>de cada animación creada y los almacena como una trayectoria de dirección independiente.<sb>Nuestro sistema predice sobre la marcha el destino de cada pie al dar<sb>el siguiente paso en función<cr>del movimiento de la animación,<sb>la trayectoria del personaje y la altura del suelo.<sb>Las parejas de cajas de colores del suelo reflejan este proceso.<sb>Las cajas rojas indican<cr>las posiciones anteriores del pie.<sb>Las cajas verdes indican<cr>la posición actual del pie del soldado,<sb>y las azules muestran dónde se prevé que se coloque el pie a continuación.<sb>Una vez que se calculan las posiciones previstas del pie, el sistema guía<sb>ambos pies a las ubicaciones previstas valiéndose de la información de la trayectoria<sb>para preservar el estilo de la animación original.<sb>Cuando el pie pisa el suelo, se fija en el sitio hasta realizar el próximo paso.<sb>Este sistema resultó tan eficaz que básicamente podíamos hacer<sb>que cualquier animación caminase hacia cualquier dirección sin deslizar los pies.<sb>Puedes experimentar con el sistema<cr>desplazándote por la zona,<sb>ya que este soldado siempre está orientado hacia ti mientras sigue su ruta.
Las minas de pared han aparecido en otros <I>Half-Life<I> y el acto de desactivarlas<sb>parecía encajar muy bien en un juego de realidad virtual, donde los jugadores pueden realizar operaciones más complejas con las manos.<sb>Llegados a este punto, los jugadores ya saben cómo hackear tecnología de la Alianza<sb>con la multiherramienta, pero queríamos que la desactivación de una mina de pared fuesen rompecabezas más tensos.<sb>Para desactivar una mina de pared, el jugador no solo debe colocar la mano junto<sb>al láser que podría hacerla estallar, sino también realizar esa tarea en unos pocos segundos.<sb>Las primeras versiones de este rompecabezas se inspiraron en una ganzúa,<sb>y el jugador debía alinear rápidamente<cr>una serie de tambores.<sb>Por desgracia, este diseño requería que los jugadores giraran las muñecas<sb>de forma incómoda, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta<sb>que había que esquivar el rayo láser.<sb>Eliminamos la rotación, pero mantuvimos<cr>el límite de tiempo,<sb>hasta llegar a la mecánica que se ve<cr>en la versión final del juego.<sb>También probamos a hacer que las minas de pared explotasen si el jugador<sb>no lograba desactivarlas, pero a la mayoría esto les parecía demasiado despiadado,<sb>sobre todo en casos donde podía producirse una reacción de explosiones en cadena.<sb>En lugar de eso, las minas siguen activas y el jugador puede tratar de desactivarlas una vez más.<sb>Al final decidimos mantener esta opción<cr>en el modo difícil,<sb>aunque añadimos un sonido de advertencia que se activa segundos antes de que explote la mina<sb>para que los jugadores tengan tiempo de alejarse.<sb>También probamos a permitir que el jugador recogiera las minas desactivadas<sb>y las colocase en otra parte, pero no habíamos diseñado suficientes situaciones de combate<sb>para esta mecánica como para que resultara satisfactoria en la práctica,<cr>y optamos por descartarla.
Esta zona de combate que se repite mientras el jugador serpentea por los bloques<sb>de pisos formó parte de uno de los primeros mapas de pruebas creados<sb>cuando comenzamos a añadir soldados de la Alianza en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Una de las lecciones que aprendimos con estos encuentros fue<sb>que a los jugadores les agotaba físicamente enfrentarse a los soldados de la Alianza<sb>y debíamos prestarle atención al ritmo.<sb>Ponerse a cubierto, recargar, cambiar de arma y detectar blancos<sb>obligaba a los jugadores a emplear todas las habilidades aprendidas hasta ese momento.<sb>Para reducir su agotamiento, incluimos pausas entre los encuentros de la Alianza<sb>y eliminamos partes del combate para hacer que la experiencia fuera más fluida.<sb>Las minas de pared en el hueco de la escalera posterior a esta batalla son un buen ejemplo<sb>de uno de los elementos empleados para dar un respiro al jugador<sb>y dejar que se recupere antes de que se incremente el ritmo de combate.
Para los artistas y diseñadores de niveles,<cr>el uso de narrativa ambiental<sb>para crear la imagen de qué podría haber sucedido dentro de los muros<sb>de la zona de cuarentena fue un desafío<cr>de lo más interesante.<sb>Al igual que el hotel, la vegetación de Xen ha absorbido estos pisos<sb>repletos de pertenencias de la gente que los abandonó apresuradamente.<sb>En esta zona las paredes están derrumbadas,<cr>ya sea por culpa<sb>de tormentas de portales o de los intentos de la Alianza de limpiar la zona.<sb>Los barriles de fluido que usan los obreros para lidiar con la vegetación de Xen<cr>o detener su expansión<sb>se han abandonado, y da la impresión de que sus intentos han fracasado o se han abandonado.<sb>El hecho de no explicar todos los aspectos del mundo proporciona a los jugadores<sb>la oportunidad de imaginar<cr>cómo es la vida en Ciudad 17.
En cuanto tuvimos la espina dorsal del juego,<cr>los equipos revisaron los mapas<sb>en busca de más oportunidades para incluir<cr>la personalidad y el estilo<sb>que los jugadores asocian a la saga <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb>Este cangrejo con el maniquí nos dio la oportunidad de darle un toque divertido al juego y hacer un guiño<sb>a películas de ciencia ficción, terror o serie B.<sb>Estuvimos pensando cuánto tiempo deberíamos dejar que el cangrejo estuviera<sb>sobre el maniquí, y decidimos que la experiencia tendría que ser similar<sb>a cuando pillas a un perrito haciendo una travesura.<sb>Queríamos que los jugadores sintieran que eran testigos de algo que no deberían ver<sb>y que terminaran imaginando<cr>que podían encontrar algo<sb>en todos los rincones del juego<cr>si se animaban a explorarlos.<sb>Tras una actualización inicial en los sonidos del cangrejo en la que se añadieron por primera vez<sb>detalles como la respiración y gruñidos,<cr>recibimos comentarios<sb>que decían que los sonidos nuevos eran demasiado adorables y resultaban muy familiares, <cr>y el cangrejo parecía más<sb>una criatura achuchable que una amenaza extraterrestre.<sb>Hemos actualizado los sonidos para que resulten más aterradores, pero con este cangrejo<sb>rescatamos algunos de los sonidos<cr>más adorables para reflejar<sb>la frustración de la criatura con el maniquí.
Para reducir la cantidad de recargas necesarias<cr>en el fragor de la batalla,<sb>queríamos que los jugadores pudieran mejorar su pistola aumentando la capacidad de munición.<sb>Tal vez no parezca un gran cambio, pero integrarlo de forma que resultase intuitivo<sb>para los jugadores<cr>y que no tuviera muchas desventajas<sb>resultó bastante difícil de conseguir.<sb>La mecánica inicial para aumentar la capacidad de munición de la pistola fue usar<cr>cargadores el doble de grandes.<sb>Después de mejorar la pistola, la mochila del jugador tenía cargadores con el doble<sb>de balas, representados con un modelo<cr>de cargador el doble de largo.<sb>Por desgracia, los cargadores más largos ocasionaban muchos problemas ficticios<cr>que distraían.<sb>Para empezar, la forma en la que sobresalían de la parte inferior de la pistola era ridícula.<sb>Además, los jugadores se preguntaban<cr>qué hacía la mochila<sb>para transformar los cargadores individuales<cr>que habían metido<sb>en las versiones con el doble<cr>de capacidad que sacaban.<sb>También se daba a entender algo absurdo:<cr>que los cargadores que había<sb>por el mundo ahora tenían que mejorarse a la versión doble por arte de magia.<sb>Aunque descartamos los cargadores dobles,<cr>el concepto nos seguía gustando.<sb>Solo había que dar<cr>con una metáfora más convincente.<sb>Así que empezamos a examinar las tolvas que se usan en las pistolas de "paintball"<sb>que pueden cargar muchas bolas de pintura.<sb>De hecho, el equipo sigue llamando "tolva de balas" a la mejora final<sb>que resultó de todas estas ideas.<sb>Teniendo esto en cuenta, lo siguiente era diseñar un modelo de interacción intuitivo.<sb>A los jugadores ya les gustaba el bucle<cr>de interacción existente con la pistola:<sb>sacar el cargador, insertar el nuevo, meter la bala en la recámara y disparar.<sb>Queríamos mantener las habilidades que los jugadores ya empezaban a dominar.<sb>Los jugadores seguían recargando el arma como antes, pero unos pequeños dientes mecánicos<sb>extraían las balas del cargador insertado,<cr>las metían en la tolva<sb>y las introducían en la recámara<cr>según fuera necesario.<sb>También se incluyeron pistas sonoras para comunicar claramente el estado<cr>del proceso de carga de la tolva.<sb>La tolva también afectó al diseño visual que usamos para reflejar el estado de la pistola.<sb>Originalmente, los cargadores tenían un contador numérico que indicaba la cantidad<sb>de balas restantes. Funcionaba bien y los jugadores lo entendían fácilmente.<sb>Sin embargo, en la tolva esto se indicaba<cr>en el lado opuesto de la pistola,<sb>que tenía un patrón de puntos azules que indicaba la cantidad de balas restantes.<sb>Por lo tanto, estas dos representaciones<cr>en dos lugares distintos dificultaban<sb>que los jugadores supieran rápidamente la cantidad total de balas del arma mejorada.<sb>Para resolver este problema,<cr>creamos un único indicador en el lateral de la empuñadura<cr>de la pistola.<sb>Estructuralmente, indicaba el estado del cargador<sb>y la recámara de la pistola,<sb>así como la tolva, si se adquiría la mejora.
En el caso de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>,<cr>queríamos ampliar la funcionalidad<sb>del sistema de paisaje acústico, que se emplea para reproducir sonidos del ambiente.<sb>En juegos anteriores solo podíamos reproducir<cr>un paisaje acústico a la vez.<sb>El jugador escuchaba el paisaje acústico A o el B<sb>con un breve crossfade o encadenado<cr>de audio entre uno y otro.<sb>En este juego, los paisajes acústicos<cr>son mucho más flexibles y se pueden superponer,<sb>de modo que las transiciones<cr>son más realistas.<sb>Por ejemplo, el volumen de diferentes paisajes acústicos se puede controlar según<sb>la posición del jugador y si puertas específicas<cr>del mundo están abiertas o cerradas.<sb>A menudo recurrimos a esta opción<cr>en zonas como esta, con una transición<cr>entre espacios interiores y exteriores.<sb>Si pausas el juego un momento en el exterior, te percatarás de los grillos, los pájaros,<sb>los ladridos que se escuchan a lo lejos y otros sonidos ambientales que sirven para trazar<sb>cómo es la zona de cuarentena al final del día.<sb>Conforme te adentras en el área interior,<cr>notarás que el paisaje acústico<sb>del exterior disminuye conforme<cr>te alejas de la puerta.<sb>De hecho, si cierras la puerta, el volumen del paisaje acústico del exterior se reducirá más aún.<sb>A medida que te adentres en el edificio,<cr>empezarás a percatarte<sb>del paisaje acústico del interior, formado por el tenue zumbido de las máquinas<cr>y otros aparatos eléctricos.
Es habitual que todos los tipos nuevos de enemigo tengan una sección del juego<sb>dedicada a presentarlos.<sb>No solemos crear dicha presentación<cr>al comienzo del proceso,<sb>puesto que las pruebas nos ayudan a conocer con exactitud<sb>los aspectos que debemos destacar del nuevo enemigo cuando lo presentamos.<sb>Además de explicar<cr>las capacidades del enemigo nuevo,<sb>estas presentaciones también nos ayudan a consolidar la existencia<sb>de ese enemigo en la mente del jugador.<sb>Sin una introducción explícita,<cr>los jugadores de pruebas<sb>suelen confundir unos enemigos con otros<cr>o mezclarlos en su cabeza.<sb>Eso sucedió con el supresor, una clase de soldado<sb>diseñada para atrapar a un jugador a cubierto mientras otros soldados van a por él.<sb>El supresor es una vuelta de tuerca respecto a otras clases de soldados,<sb>ya que todos se centraban en obligar al jugador a dejar de cubrirse.<sb>La presentación del supresor se extiende a las siguientes dos salas.<sb>En la primera, los jugadores ven al supresor disparando a unos zombis,<sb>lo que les da un momento para observar con tranquilidad cómo ataca.<sb>También pueden escuchar y aprender los sonidos de este enemigo, algo que resultará importante en encuentros futuros.<sb>En la segunda sala, los jugadores aprenden a enfrentarse al supresor.<sb>Esto no tiene mucha complicación cuando<cr>el supresor está solo,<sb>pero resultará más complejo en el futuro, cuando aparezca junto con soldados de otros tipos.
No resulta práctico invertir tiempo de desarrollo ni recursos artísticos equitativamente<sb>en todas las partes del juego, así que nos servimos de la reutilización estratégica<sb>de recursos para mantener la fidelidad y particularidad de los entornos de un juego.<sb>Este espacio se construyó inicialmente con modelos y texturas industriales<sb>que pueden apreciarse<cr>en varios entornos anteriores.<sb>Para distinguirlos, añadimos los cables y cápsulas de vortigaunts con el fin de indicar<sb>que se trata de una central nuclear de la Alianza improvisada cuyo fin era<cr>transferir energía a las subestaciones.<sb>La combinación de este espacio industrial abandonado con los enormes cables de la Alianza<sb>creó suficiente interés visual para que pareciera un lugar importante sin invertir demasiados recursos.<sb>Los cables se añadieron posteriormente en otras partes del juego para aumentar<sb>el interés visual y darle al jugador la sensación de que se dirige hacia la bóveda.<sb>Tal vez no sea evidente, pero los cables que salen de este techo continúan hasta<sb>el exterior del edificio, recorren el gran patio de construcción<sb>y suben por el tejado de la destilería<sb>y, presuntamente, hasta una subestación u otra infraestructura de la Alianza.<sb>Puede que los jugadores no se den cuenta,<cr>pero detalles como estos<sb>nos ayudan a crear un mundo<cr>coherente e interconectado.
Un problema al que nos enfrentamos con los estilos de movimientos en realidad virtual de <I>Alyx<I> fue<sb>evitar que la experiencia de combate<cr>fuera distinta dependiendo<sb>de si los jugadores usaban el teletransporte<cr>o el movimiento continuo.<sb>Si los combates fueran muy distintos en función<cr>del tipo de movimiento<sb>del jugador, la cantidad de combinaciones posibles que tendríamos que probar sería muchísimo mayor.<sb>Una forma de evitar este aumento de posibilidades fue asegurarnos de que las IA<sb>detectaban los movimientos del jugador sin importar el estilo que estuviera utilizando.<sb>Para ello, creamos un sustituto visual de los jugadores que se movieran<cr>mediante el teletransporte.<sb>Por ejemplo, imagina que un jugador está a cubierto y hay un soldado que no puede verlo.<sb>Si el jugador usa el movimiento continuo<cr>para correr hasta otro lugar seguro,<sb>el soldado lo verá mientras<cr>recorre el espacio abierto.<sb>Sin embargo, si el jugador se teletransportara al instante de un lugar seguro al siguiente,<cr>el soldado no lo vería.<sb>Para solucionar esta discrepancia, cuando un jugador se teletransporta, deja un rastro<sb>de sustitutos visuales invisibles que<cr>la IA enemiga puede detectar.<sb>La IA reconoce estos sustitutos del mismo modo que si hubiera visto<sb>al jugador realizar el movimiento directamente.<sb>En este caso, aunque el jugador se teletransporte, el soldado se daría cuenta de que ha dejado<sb>de estar a cubierto y ha corrido hasta un lugar seguro, igual que si hubiera usado<cr>el movimiento continuo.<sb>Aunque estas situaciones no son idénticas, puesto que el soldado no podría disparar<sb>al jugador si se teletransporta, este tipo de funciones nos permitieron reducir<sb>la cantidad de opciones de movimiento del jugador que debe tener en cuenta la IA.
Para los modos de locomoción continua y de teletransporte, ofrecemos distintas<cr>formas de subir escaleras.<sb>Por defecto, los jugadores que usan el teletransporte pueden dirigirse a una escalera y,<sb>tras un breve espacio de tiempo, aparecer en la parte superior o inferior, según su posición original.<sb>Ese tiempo era necesario para asegurarnos de que los jugadores usaban<cr>la escalera intencionadamente.<sb>Queríamos evitar que usaran la escalera sin querer y se desorientaran al encontrarse<cr>en el otro extremo.<sb>Los jugadores que usan la locomoción continua pueden agarrar directamente la escalera<cr>para subir o bajar.<sb>En este modo, pueden coger un peldaño y bajar la mano para impulsar el cuerpo hacia arriba<cr>o subirla para descender.<sb>Esto permite a los jugadores subir o bajar la escalera peldaño por peldaño con naturalidad.<sb>Este modo fue tan popular que lo añadimos como opción incluso para los jugadores<cr>que usan el teletransporte.<sb>Lo cierto es que la mayoría de las escaleras del juego no se extienden mucho más allá de la zona donde terminan en la parte superior.<sb>Esto hizo que a muchos jugadores les costara bajarse de la parte superior de la escalera si usaban el método continuo, ya que había muy poca escalera a la que agarrarse al llegar arriba.<sb>Para solucionarlo, detectamos cuándo los jugadores sueltan la escalera con ambas manos y los teletransportamos automáticamente al extremo superior o inferior,dependiendo de<cr>hacia dónde se dirigieran.<sb>Por desgracia, el juego no incluye muchas explicaciones explícitas sobre las escaleras, así que a algunos jugadores les pilla por sorpresa este teletransporte si se sueltan<cr>con las dos manos por error.<sb>Aun así, resultó ser una alternativa mejor que dejarlos colgando o hacer que se cayeran si soltaban ambas manos, sobre todo porque algunas de las escaleras son bastante largas y habría sido un fastidio tener que volver a subir por haberse soltado poco antes de llegar al final.
Algunos de los experimentos iniciales del proyecto se centraron en colocar antiguos modelos<sb>de <I>Half-Life 2<I> en un nivel y<cr>andar a su alrededor en realidad virtual.<sb>Estos incluyeron modelos estáticos de enemigos, como los soldados de la Alianza o los zombis.<sb>Descubrimos que a los jugadores les encantaba inspeccionar estos modelos,<sb>porque la realidad virtual les permitía acercarse mucho más a ellos que en los juegos anteriores.<sb>Los jugadores comentaban que percibían mejor el tamaño de los personajes<sb>y señalaban detalles en los que<cr>jamás se habían fijado,<sb>a pesar de haber visto los modelos<cr>muchas veces en <I>Half-Life 2<I>.<sb>Estas reacciones nos ayudaron a crear un enemigo que aprovechaba<sb>esa experiencia y requería<cr>que los jugadores pasaran<sb>mucho tiempo físicamente cerca de él.<sb>Pero los enemigos no suelen permitir que el jugador se les acerque sin atacar,<sb>así que nos parecía lógico que<cr>este enemigo fuera ciego,<sb>y centramos el enfrentamiento en mecánicas de juego sin combate.<sb>Los primeros experimentos para guiar a una criatura ciega con sonidos resultaron interesantes<sb>al instante y nos dieron la oportunidad de crear situaciones únicas del producto.<sb>Y así surgió el concepto de Jeff, conocido entre el equipo como el zombi ciego.
La flora de Xen que ves en esta pared,<cr>a la que nos referimos como orejas de Xen<sb>por motivos evidentes, reacciona a<cr>los mismos sonidos que Jeff.<sb>En las primeras etapas del desarrollo, observamos situaciones en las que los jugadores de pruebas<sb>no se percataban de que<cr>Jeff se enfurecía por un sonido.<sb>Si un jugador moría a causa de esto, se sentía frustrado y le parecía injusto.<sb>Nos esforzamos para que las animaciones y sonidos de Jeff reflejasen su nivel<sb>de agresividad hacia el jugador<cr>con la mayor claridad posible,<sb>pero si los jugadores no lo miraban,<cr>podía pillarlos desprevenidos.<sb>Incluir esta vegetación de orejas de Xen<cr>en el entorno nos sirvió<sb>para ayudar a los jugadores a estar más alerta a cómo reacciona Jeff ante el sonido.<sb>Las orejas de Xen añaden información visual extra sobre el comportamiento<sb>de Jeff que no proviene de él, sino del entorno.
Desde el comienzo del desarrollo, nuestra intención fue incluir una variedad<sb>de flora y fauna de Xen visualmente característica para <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>.<sb>Sin embargo, todavía no sabíamos cómo usar esos elementos visuales<sb>para ofrecer una jugabilidad interesante.<sb>Lo que nosotros llamamos "plantas carnívoras de Xen", la vegetación de Xen que ves aquí, se creó<sb>en un principio para dar un toque visual, y contaba con una interactividad muy leve.<sb>Estas plantas seguían la cabeza<cr>y las manos del jugador,<sb>y se cerraban de golpe si se acercaba demasiado.<sb>Cuando empezamos a trabajar con Jeff, queríamos buscar formas nuevas<sb>y sorprendentes de emplear el sonido como una mecánica principal del juego.<sb>En concreto, queríamos que los jugadores estuvieran alerta del entorno que los rodea.<sb>Nos dimos cuenta de que podíamos usar las plantas carnívoras de Xen<cr>como un tipo de peligro sonoro<sb>haciendo que se abrieran y cerraran repetidamente cuando el jugador se acercaba.<sb>Ya habíamos colocado estas plantas carnívoras en partes anteriores del juego,<sb>así que los jugadores llegaban a la destilería<sb>sabiendo cómo funcionaba esta mecánica.<sb>La presentación de Jeff cambió la relación del jugador con las plantas carnívoras de Xen:<sb>pasaron de ser molestas pero inofensivas<cr>a representar un gran peligro<sb>que había que procurar evitar.
Las primeras versiones de la destilería exploraban una variedad de métodos para enseñar<sb>a los jugadores de forma sutil el comportamiento de Jeff sin ninguna explicación explícita.<sb>Aunque algunas de las técnicas de entrenamiento tuvieron mucho éxito, si los jugadores<sb>no entendían del todo el comportamiento de Jeff, al llegar a esta parte del juego<sb>avanzaban de forma muy torpe y lo pasaban fatal.<sb>Al final, decidimos que era necesaria una explicación más explícita,<sb>y ahí es donde entra en escena<cr>el personaje de Larry.<sb>El papel de Larry es<cr>ofrecer información esencial sobre<sb>el comportamiento de Jeff antes de permitir que<cr>el jugador avance.<sb>Asegurarnos de que dejábamos claras las normas de Jeff logrando que Larry<cr>fuera un personaje interesante<sb>conllevó un aprendizaje denso y<cr>requirió un equilibrio preciso.<sb>Para distribuir esta explicación, se repartió en varios momentos narrativos distintos<sb>en los que Larry presenta a Jeff, luego señala<cr>la reacción predecible de Jeff<sb>al romperse una botella y, por último,<cr>explica que el jugador<sb>puede taparse la boca para evitar toser<cr>por las esporas de Xen.
Un elemento principal del entorno y de Jeff<cr>son las plantas de Xen que ves aquí,<sb>que emiten un gas tóxico que hace toser al jugador.<sb>Estas plantas no se crearon como un simple adorno ni para hacer uso<sb>de la novedosa interacción en realidad virtual<cr>de taparse la boca.<sb>Se añadieron específicamente para resolver<cr>un desafío bastante longevo<sb>de reflejar el espacio personal de Jeff.<sb>Uno de los aspectos más complejos a la hora de diseñar a Jeff fue lograr<sb>el equilibrio adecuado entre<cr>el peligro percibido y el real.<sb>Muchos escenarios del nivel obligan<cr>al jugador a acercarse<sb>a Jeff para crear tensión.<sb>Descubrimos que estas situaciones podían ser emocionantes, aunque también<sb>podían causar frustración si los jugadores se acercaban más de la cuenta a Jeff<cr>y morían inesperadamente.<sb>Los jugadores nos decían que no sabían cuánto podían acercarse.<sb>Probamos un par de soluciones, como ponerle a Jeff unos tentáculos brillantes<sb>que representaban visualmente el perímetro<cr>de su espacio personal.<sb>Si tocas los tentáculos, te mueres.<sb>Sin embargo, era muy complicado hacer que<cr>los tentáculos tuvieran<sb>un aspecto satisfactorio y terminamos<cr>por descartar la idea.<sb>Otro problema al que nos enfrentamos fue que un puñado de jugadores<sb>enseguida se siguieron cómodos con Jeff<cr>en cuanto aprendieron<sb>a mantenerse a la distancia adecuada<cr>y evitar hacer ruido.<sb>Para estos jugadores, la presencia de Jeff<cr>era irrelevante.<sb>Simplemente, no lo percibían como un peligro.<sb>Pensamos en varias soluciones<cr>para resolver estos problemas,<sb>e incluso se nos ocurrieron conceptos tan alocados como hacer que Jeff pudiera teletransportarse<sb>hacia fuentes de sonido,<cr>pero era difícil dar con ideas<sb>con las que no pareciera que<cr>Jeff estaba "haciendo trampas".<sb>Finalmente, se nos ocurrió hacer que<cr>el jugador pudiera <I>toser<I>.<sb>Esta era una opción atractiva, ya que nos permitía convertir a los jugadores<sb>en un ruido más, haciendo así que<cr>Jeff los persiguiera.<sb>También nos interesaba hacer que<cr>el entorno fuera más peligroso<sb>a rasgos generales, por lo que nuestros primeros experimentos con la tos consistieron<sb>en diseminar plantas de Xen<cr>que soltaban un gas venenoso.<sb>Las pruebas iniciales fueron prometedoras.<sb>Ahora los jugadores sí que veían a Jeff como una amenaza y debían estar<sb>muy pendientes de lo que los<cr>rodeaba para evitar el gas.<sb>Nos percatamos de que los jugadores se tapaban la boca con la mano<sb>instintivamente para contener la tos.<sb>La realidad virtual con mandos<cr>de seguimiento de manos<sb>detecta este movimiento sin problema, así que añadimos esta mecánica de inmediato.<sb>Pero aún quedaba un problema por resolver: cuánto podían acercarse<sb>los jugadores a Jeff sin ponerse en peligro.<sb>Nos dimos cuenta de que la idea anterior de ponerle tentáculos a Jeff se podía sustituir<sb>con una solución mucho más sencilla:<cr>rodearlo con una nube tóxica.<sb>Esto ofrecía muchas ventajas.<sb>Para empezar, les daba a los jugadores información visual sobre lo lejos<sb>que debían estar de Jeff para seguir a salvo.<sb>Además, hacía más tensos los momentos en los que Jeff se acercaba mucho;<sb>ahora los jugadores tendrían que usar una mano para taparse la boca.<sb>Por último, no teníamos que enseñarles nada nuevo a los jugadores.<sb>Podían aprovechar lo que ya<cr>habían aprendido sobre<sb>el gas tóxico del entorno y aplicarlo con Jeff.
Uno de los principales objetivos<cr>en el diseño de <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I><sb>fue llegar al mayor público posible.<sb>Esto implicaba que el juego fuera compatible con los principales aparatos<cr>de realidad virtual del mercado,<sb>los distintos espacios de juego posibles, las preferencias de desplazamiento, etcétera.<sb>La opción de accesibilidad que tuvo la mayor repercusión en el diseño del juego,<sb>desde los controles, pasando por la lógica del juego y hasta el diseño de niveles,<sb>fue habilitar un modo de mando único<sb>para jugadores que no usan dos.<sb>En este modo, la recarga se realiza<cr>llevando el arma al hombro<sb>y pulsando un botón, de forma similar a los juegos de arcade en los que<sb>el jugador tenía que disparar el arma fuera de la pantalla para recargar.<sb>La linterna se modificó para acoplarse a la mano principal y se añadieron máscaras de gas<sb>para que los jugadores pudieran<cr>contener la tos sin usar las manos.<sb>Incluso se modificó el arma empleada en la última batalla con el zancudo,<sb>con controles para apuntar y recargar con dos manos, para que se utilizara con una sola mano.
Mientras pulíamos el comportamiento y el diseño visual de Jeff, pensamos<sb>largo y tendido sobre lo que queríamos transmitir a los jugadores con este personaje.<sb>El objetivo era que los jugadores de pruebas describieran a Jeff con términos<sb>como "amenazador" "terrorífico" y "letal".<sb>Con esto en mente, era importante que<cr>los jugadores no sobrevivieran<sb>si se acercaban demasiado a Jeff, así que decidimos que su ataque<sb>tuviera como consecuencia la muerte instantánea.<sb>Esto dejaría claro a los jugadores que Jeff era demasiado peligroso<sb>como para subestimarlo, pero esto presentó un desafío: ¿cómo explicaríamos esto<sb>a los jugadores sin tener que matarlos?<sb>El método que empleamos fue darle oportunidades al jugador para que viera<sb>cómo Jeff ataca y mata a <I>otros<I> personajes.<sb>Las primeras versiones del nivel tenían escenarios en los que Jeff y el jugador<sb>se encontraban con zombis y soldados de la Alianza.<sb>El jugador podía atacar a estos enemigos o recurrir a sonidos para atraer a Jeff<sb>al lugar deseado y que este los destrozara<cr>con sus enormes brazos.<sb>Esto les daba a los jugadores la oportunidad de comprobar el poder de Jeff<sb>y su forma de atacar sin tener que morir.<sb>Por desgracia, este no siempre era el resultado logrado, ya que algunos jugadores<sb>decidían matar a estos enemigos por su cuenta.<sb>Además, tener presentes a otros personajes resultaba bastante costoso<sb>en cuanto a animación, sonido<cr>y contenido de los niveles.<sb>Ya era bastante difícil lograr que este nivel tuviera<sb>un buen ritmo y no usara demasiados recursos,<cr>así que omitimos estas partes.<sb>Sin embargo, esto nos devolvió al problema original: cómo mostrar<sb>lo letal que era Jeff sin matar al jugador.<sb>Decidimos abordar este problema añadiendo partes a las secuencias animadas ya existentes.<sb>Por ejemplo, cuando el jugador abre esta puerta enrollable con ambas manos<sb>añadimos un cangrejo para que se vea<cr>cómo Jeff se ensaña con él.<sb>También añadimos una parte similar al viaje en ascensor posterior, en el que Jeff<sb>golpea a un cangrejo contra el muro<cr>antes de derretirlo con ácido.
Aunque Larry le explica al jugador el comportamiento básico de Jeff,<sb>descubrimos que era necesario poner a prueba esas reglas sin colocar a Jeff<sb>en su espacio personal inmediato.<sb>Si hacíamos que los jugadores interactuaran cara a cara con Jeff desde el principio,<sb>era muy común que se inquietaran<cr>y olvidaran las reglas.<sb>Morían una y otra vez, y el miedo inicial a Jeff<sb>no tardaba mucho en convertirse<cr>en frustración y fastidio.<sb>Esta zona se creó como una especie de campo de entrenamiento donde los jugadores<sb>pueden observar cómo Jeff reacciona a distintos sonidos sin tener que sufrir sus ataques.<sb>Contiene varios de los elementos que se encuentran en el resto del nivel,<sb>como botellas que se caen, un candado al que<sb>hay que disparar y varios tipos de plantas de Xen.<sb>Jeff está lo suficientemente cerca como para resultar amenazador, pero no puede<cr>atacar al jugador.<sb>Los jugadores pueden pasar todo el tiempo<cr>que quieran aquí<sb>y marcharse cuando crean haber comprendido<cr>el funcionamiento de Jeff.
El diseño de Jeff pasó<cr>por varios cambios considerables<sb>a lo largo del proceso de desarrollo.<sb>Queríamos que los personajes comprendieran<cr>una serie de cosas<sb>sobre este personaje solo con mirarlo.<sb>Nuestra prioridad fue dejar clara su ceguera.<sb>Después, queríamos que el personaje tuviera un aspecto imponente a nivel físico.<sb>Al fin y al cabo, el concepto de Jeff había surgido<cr>al observar que,<sb>en realidad virtual, el simple hecho de ver a un personaje de cerca ya<cr>es una experiencia muy intensa.<sb>Por último, queríamos que los jugadores comprendieran a simple vista<cr>el estado de ánimo de este zombi ciego.<sb>Por ejemplo, si está enfadado,<sb>si acaba de oír algo y siente curiosidad, etcétera.<sb>El primer diseño que creamos y animamos fue una especie de robot obrero de la Alianza.<sb>La cara del robot tenía una imagen holográfica<sb>que mostraba varios iconos<cr>para reflejar su estado de ánimo.<sb>De la nuca del robot sobresalía<cr>una enorme barra de acero<sb>que soltaba chispas y echaba humo.<sb>Con esto queríamos dar a entender que tenía inutilizados los sensores visuales y estaba ciego.<sb>Hicimos que el robot fuera alto e imponente.<sb>Tenía un aspecto voluminoso,<cr>impredecible y peligroso.<sb>Sin embargo, las reacciones de los jugadores al ver este diseño robótico revelaron<cr>una serie de problemas.<sb>Lo primero en lo que solían centrarse los jugadores era en la holografía de la cabeza.<sb>Les costaba demasiado analizar y comprender<cr>los iconos de la cara<sb>y, peor aún, este elemento los distraía de la barra de acero que sobresalía<sb>de la cabeza del robot, por lo que no se daban cuenta de que estaba ciego.<sb>El robot resultaba imponente para los jugadores, pero no logramos<sb>obtener la reacción tan visceral<cr>que estábamos buscando.<sb>Hubo que volver al punto de partida<cr>para poder crear<sb>el personaje orgánico que tienes frente a ti.<sb>Nos basamos en los mineros que sufren neumoconiosis y nos centramos<sb>en el siguiente concepto: un miembro del equipo de limpieza de la Alianza<sb>que había sucumbido a la infección de Xen.<sb>Así, obtuvimos la reacción visceral de los jugadores que estábamos buscando.<sb>Puede verse un rostro humano, pero también el deterioro en sus ojos,<cr>lo que deja más clara su ceguera.<sb>La naturaleza orgánica de este diseño nos permitió emplear más el sonido<sb>para expresar su comportamiento mediante gruñidos y rugidos propios de animales.<sb>Gradualmente añadimos<cr>más elementos acústicos humanos.
Los rompecabezas de conexiones eléctricas son una herramienta de diseño muy útil,<cr>ya que obligan a los jugadores<sb>a explorar su entorno y. de paso, ocupan su mano principal con la multiherramienta.<sb>En esta zona, el jugador<cr>debe usar la linterna para moverse<sb>y la mano libre para teletransportarse, taparse la boca para evitar toser,<sb>seguir los cables con la multiherramienta y posiblemente coger botellas<cr>con los guantes de gravedad.<sb>El jugador debe ir cambiando lo que hace con las manos, puesto que, por diseño, no puede usarlas para todo a la vez.<sb>Los jugadores que usan solo una mano se sienten mucho más abrumados<cr>al tener que realizar tantas tareas.<sb>Por eso pusimos máscaras de gas en la destilería; el jugador puede<sb>colocárselas en la boca para no tener que usar la mano para evitar toser.<sb>Esta conexión eléctrica pasó por varias revisiones, muchas de las cuales<sb>permitieron que Jeff campara a sus anchas mientras los jugadores<cr>se ocupaban del rompecabezas.<sb>Sin embargo, los jugadores tenían<cr>que lidiar con muchas cosas a la vez,<sb>y su miedo a Jeff no tardaba<cr>en convertirse en frustración.<sb>La solución fue tener encerrado a Jeff mientras los jugadores resolvían el rompecabezas,<sb>aunque sus rugidos a lo lejos<cr>mantienen el nivel de tensión.<sb>Después, tuvimos que pensar en cómo liberar<sb>a Jeff para que el nivel pudiera continuar.<sb>En nuestras primeras ideas, Jeff salía del congelador por su cuenta<sb>tras completar el rompecabezas, pero esto parecía forzado y artificial<sb>en comparación con hacer que lo liberara el jugador.<sb>La mecánica de las conexiones eléctricas nos dio una solución lógica para este problema,<sb>con la ventaja de crear un momento muy tenso<sb>para el jugador cuando se da cuenta<cr>de que tiene que abrir<sb>la puerta del congelador y liberar a Jeff<cr>para poder continuar.
Muchas de las ideas que teníamos para Jeff giraban alrededor de un mismo concepto:<sb>hacer que el jugador y él estuvieran juntos<cr>en un espacio cerrado.<sb>Al principio pensamos en un ascensor,<cr>pero no teníamos claro<sb>que esta idea fuera a funcionar en la práctica.<sb>También nos preocupaba que una secuencia así fuese costosa de realizar a nivel técnico.<sb>Nuestro primer prototipo<cr>era increíblemente rudimentario.<sb>Los jugadores se metían<cr>en un ascensor con Jeff durante<sb>unos treinta segundos, y después ambos salían.<sb>A nivel narrativo no era complicado ni había animaciones específicas para Jeff.<sb>Tampoco había sonidos especiales<cr>ni iluminaciones concretas.<sb>Pese a esta tosquedad, los jugadores reaccionaron favorablemente a la secuencia<sb>e incluso les pareció uno de los puntos fuertes del juego cuando realizamos pruebas<cr>por toda la empresa.<sb>Esto nos convenció de que merecía la pena pulir<sb>ese viaje en ascensor y convertirlo<cr>en algo muy especial.<sb>Al final, combinamos varias disciplinas distintas para crear la secuencia final,<sb>que fusiona sonido, animación, iluminación programada<sb>y una cuidada coreografía en los movimientos de Jeff y las acciones del jugador.
La mayoría del tiempo, es el jugador quien crea los sonidos que llaman la atención de Jeff,<sb>ya sea porque quiere llevarlo a una ubicación nueva<sb>o porque comete un error ruidoso que se podría haber evitado.<sb>Lo fundamental es que el jugador sienta una especie de responsabilidad<cr>por los sonidos que se generan.<sb>El objetivo del próximo pasillo era darle la vuelta esa idea, aunque fuera solo por un instante.<sb>Como una mascota traviesa, este cangrejo insolente aparece para sorprender<cr>e irritar al jugador;<sb>tira varias botellas de forma torpe y luego<cr>huye por un respiradero.<sb>¡Típico de los cangrejos!<sb>Nos sorprendió descubrir que<cr>muchos jugadores se molestaban<sb>en comprobar si el cangrejo<cr>había escapado de verdad.<sb>Se subían a las cajas e incluso metían la cabeza por los respiraderos.<sb>Esto nos dio la idea de incluir una pequeña sorpresa para recompensar<cr>a este tipo de jugadores.<sb>Si lo haces, verás que<cr>este cangrejo travieso se ha escapado.<cr>¡Aún tiene cuerda para seguir fastidiando!<sb>El coste de añadir este tipo de secretos<cr>se debe comparar<sb>con la posibilidad de que<cr>los jugadores logren encontrarlos.<sb>Durante las observaciones de pruebas nos pareció que merecía la pena el coste,<sb>sobre todo porque ayudaría a hacer que este mundo pareciera más real;<sb>una realidad donde los seres vivos<cr>siguen con sus vidas<sb>aunque el jugador no esté delante para verlas.
Como toda la premisa de Jeff se basa en que esté cerca del jugador,<sb>se construyó el mapa de la destilería como una serie<sb>de salas conectadas con transiciones<cr>de una sola dirección.<sb>Al principio combinamos dos técnicas<cr>para mantener juntos<sb>a Jeff y al jugador durante todo el nivel.<sb>Para empezar, todas las zonas nuevas terminaban con una puerta especial cerrada.<sb>Estas tenían la forma de "membranas de Xen" inexpugnables que solo Jeff podría destruir.<sb>El jugador tenía que atraer a Jeff a la membrana valiéndose de sonidos,<sb>y este abriría la puerta para que<cr>ambos pudieran avanzar.<sb>Nuestro objetivo siempre había sido que los jugadores vieran a Jeff como un adversario,<sb>un acechador constante o una molestia.<sb>El problema del concepto de la membrana de Xen era que los jugadores<sb>describían a Jeff como una herramienta útil o, peor aún, como un "compañero con malas pulgas" y no alguien a quien temer.<sb>Otra forma de mantener juntos<cr>a Jeff y al jugador era<sb>mediante el uso de caídas de sentido único.<sb>Jeff se caía de pasarelas, plataformas y escaleras y acababa en una zona nueva.<sb>Estas caídas funcionaban como habíamos previsto. Sin embargo, al igual que las membranas de Xen,<sb>causaban una reacción no deseada en los jugadores, sobre todo<cr>cuando se repetían varias veces.<sb>Ver a Jeff cayéndose de culo hacía que los jugadores no lo percibieran como un peligro.<sb>Les daba pena o incluso se reían de él.<sb>Al final, nos dimos cuenta de que podíamos usar los campos de fuerza de la Alianza,<sb>que el jugador <I>no puede<I> atravesar, para crear "puertas de sentido único".<sb>Jeff podía cruzar estos campos de fuerza,<sb>pero el jugador debía seguirlo por otro camino<cr>de una sola dirección.<sb>Esto nos permitió crear umbrales en los que tanto Jeff como el jugador podían<sb>avanzar, eliminar la incomodidad<cr>de las membranas de Xen<sb>y evitar las caídas constantes que dejaban a Jeff como una criatura torpe.<sb>Además, los campos de fuerza de la Alianza también ofrecían otras ventajas.<sb>Para empezar, le daban a Jeff la oportunidad de seguir una ruta "trasera"<sb>inaccesible para el jugador, como<cr>la del final de esta escalera.<sb>Este aspecto encajaba a la perfección con la historia de Jeff como antiguo miembro del equipo de limpieza de la Alianza.
Crear una experiencia tan basada en el sonido<sb>presentaba una serie de problemas<cr>específicos de diseño.<sb>El mayor desafío de todos fue determinar los sonidos que Jeff podría oír<sb>y asegurarnos de que los jugadores<cr>comprendían las reglas.<sb><I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> contiene una gran variedad<cr>de objetos físicos.<sb>Sin embargo, durante las pruebas descubrimos<cr>que lo mejor era<sb>emplear solo un conjunto reducido para la destilería.<sb>Debíamos pensar cuidadosamente qué objetos íbamos a incluir,<sb>teniendo en cuenta el diseño acústico de los choques entre cada objeto<sb>y los diferentes tipos de superficies<cr>que hay en la destilería.<sb>Era importante que el sonido que oían<cr>los jugadores encajara<sb>con sus expectativas de cómo iba a reaccionar Jeff.<sb>Durante las primeras pruebas, encontramos casos específicos en los que los jugadores<sb>no sabían por qué se había enfadado Jeff, o bien<sb>esperaban que un ruido en particular<cr>llamase su atención.<sb>Poco a poco identificamos los casos que creaban confusión y les pusimos remedio.<sb>Era fundamental que los jugadores identificaran<cr>en todo momento<sb>la causa y el efecto de un sonido<cr>que pudiera atraer a Jeff.<sb>De lo contrario, los jugadores tendrían<cr>la impresión de que Jeff<sb>actuaba de forma aleatoria y<cr>terminarían por frustrarse.<sb>Algunos de los experimentos relacionados fallaron.<sb>Había partes del nivel cubiertas<cr>con montones de cristales rotos<sb>que hacían ruido si el jugador los pisaba o se teletransportaba hacia ellos.<sb>La mayoría de los jugadores no veía<cr>estos cristales y se sorprendía<sb>cuando Jeff los atacaba, así que descartamos esta idea para evitar confusiones.<sb>También debíamos tener cuidado con la otra posibilidad: que los jugadores<sb>esperasen que elementos meramente visuales fuesen un peligro acústico.<sb>Por ejemplo, colocamos charcos de agua poco profundos que se filtraban<cr>por las baldosas del suelo.<sb>Visualmente eran una pasada, pero confundían a algunos jugadores de pruebas, que pensaban<sb>que Jeff oiría el sonido de sus pasos<cr>al pisar estos charcos,<sb>aunque eso jamás fue nuestra intención.
Dar con la forma adecuada de finalizar<cr>el recorrido por la destilería<sb>abrió muchos debates sobre qué opinarían<cr>los jugadores de Jeff.<sb>Al observar las pruebas, vimos que<cr>la mayoría de los jugadores<sb>querían verlo muerto,<cr>normalmente desde el primer encuentro.<sb>Aun así, también había quien sentía lástima por él<sb>y no quería que muriera.<sb>La primera versión del final hacía que las acciones del jugador provocaran<sb>accidentalmente que las hormigas león atacaran<cr>a Jeff y se lo llevaran.<sb>Parte del objetivo era demostrar que las hormigas león son incluso más fuertes<sb>que Jeff, para aumentar la tensión justo antes de que los jugadores<sb>tuvieran que enfrentarse a estas criaturas.<sb>Sin embargo, esto hacía que los jugadores sintieran que faltaba algo;<sb>no habían conectado con la muerte de Jeff y querían un papel más activo.<sb>Sí, es un poco macabro.<sb>Además, no estábamos satisfaciendo<cr>a los jugadores<sb>que sentían lástima por Jeff<cr>y no querían que muriera.<sb>Y también había otros problemas.<sb>A muchos les parecía que el ataque de las hormigas león no venía a cuento, y eso reducía<cr>el impacto de la escena.<sb>Como los jugadores no llegaban a ver la muerte de Jeff, no sentían que su historia<cr>se cerrara adecuadamente.<sb>Esto impedía que los jugadores<cr>pudieran cambiar el chip<sb>y prepararse para su enfrentamiento<cr>contra las hormigas león.<sb>El compactador de basura fue la solución perfecta.<sb>Les dio a los jugadores la oportunidad de decidir<cr>el destino de Jeff y sentir<sb>que se había cerrado esa parte de la historia, tanto si decidían acabar con él<cr>como si lo dejaban encerrado.<sb>De todas formas, la mayoría de los jugadores aplastan a Jeff sin pensárselo dos veces.<sb>Monstruos.
En algunos de los primeros experimentos para llevar a los enemigos de <I>Half-Life 2<I><cr>a la realidad virtual,<sb>descubrimos que las hormigas león en especial eran rivales prometedores<sb>e interesantes, aunque solían abrumar a los jugadores de pruebas.<sb>Invadían el espacio físico del jugador muy rápido y<sb>lo presionaban tanto que<cr>este acababa teletransportándose<sb>constantemente para huir de ellas.<sb>Casi al mismo tiempo, descubrimos que todos los jugadores tenían<sb>muy buena puntería en realidad virtual, incluso los menos experimentados.<sb>La variabilidad de la capacidad<cr>para apuntar entre jugadores<sb>es mucho menor en realidad virtual que<cr>en juegos de teclado y ratón.<sb>Para aprovechar la idea de que los jugadores<cr>van a realizar tiros precisos<sb>consistentemente, empezamos a probar el diseño de una hormiga león<sb>que podía ralentizarse si se le disparaba a las patas.<sb>Los jugadores reaccionaron favorablemente<cr>a la necesidad de precisión<sb>y a la naturalidad lograda cuando<cr>una hormiga león pierde las patas<sb>y sigue avanzado hacia el jugador cojeando.<sb>La parte de quitarles las patas estaba claro, pero fue todo un reto explicar a los jugadores<sb>que el abdomen era invulnerable hasta que<cr>se destruyeran las patas.<sb>No había una solución única para transmitir<cr>esta idea de forma eficaz<sb>a los jugadores de pruebas, así que añadimos varias cosas para explicarla.<sb>Por ejemplo, hicimos que el abdomen fuera opaco y negro cuando fuese invulnerable,<sb>pero naranja y brillante como las patas<cr>cuando fuese vulnerable.<sb>Disparar a las partes blindadas de la hormiga león hacía que saltaran chispas<sb>y se escucharan sonidos de rebotes,<cr>pero al disparar a las partes vulnerables<sb>brotaba sangre naranja y se escuchaban<cr>sonidos de impactos sordos.<sb>También diseñamos las animaciones de las muertes para recalcar que el abdomen explotaba<sb>y nos aseguramos de que quedara un trozo de él tras matar a la hormiga león.
Toda la vegetación del juego reacciona cuando el jugador la toca, y también con el viento.<sb>La animación de la vegetación es puramente procedimental y se calcula con el procesador gráfico mediante una alteración<cr>del sombreador de vértices.<sb>Se utiliza un campo de vóxeles que recorre el cuerpo del jugador para rastrear la ubicación<cr>de sus manos en el espacio.<sb>Las manos del jugador producen movimientos en este campo de vóxeles,<sb>y el sombreador de la vegetación los utiliza<cr>para crear alteraciones<sb>que permiten que el jugador mueva la vegetación con las manos.<sb>La vegetación también reacciona con el viento, lo que nos permite darles un movimiento natural<cr>a las plantas.<sb>Con el fin de poder emplear una gran variedad de diseño ambiental, ajustamos las alteraciones<sb>del viento a diferentes velocidades, desde suaves brisas a vientos huracanados.<sb>No obstante, nunca fue necesario que el viento de los escenarios fuese más<sb>que una brisa moderada, así que el efecto huracanado no se empleó durante<cr>la mayor parte del desarrollo.<sb>En particular, este zoológico se añadió posteriormente y fue necesaria<sb>una ampliación considerable del sistema de animación procedimental de la vegetación.<sb>Antes de añadir este entorno, no hacía falta que la vegetación se alterara como respuesta<sb>a las animaciones de los enemigos ni a las explosiones de granadas, pero esta zona<sb>gira alrededor de lanzarles granadas a los zombis.<sb>Para abordar esta situación, añadimos un campo de vóxeles de baja resolución<sb>con el que el sombreador de vegetación puede aplicar alteraciones adicionales.<sb>Este campo de vóxeles de baja resolución, de aproximadamente un pie cúbico por vóxel,<sb>se fija en el espacio y abarca todo el zoológico.<sb>A modo de comparación, el campo de vóxeles que acompaña al jugador es de unas<cr>dos pulgadas cúbicas por vóxel.<sb>Los enemigos y las granadas en este espacio pueden trazar rastros de movimiento e impactos<sb>en el campo de vóxeles de baja resolución, y el sombreador de vegetación los detecta como viento.<sb>La preparación y la oportunidad fueron de la mano.<sb>Cuando explotan las granadas, se crean vientos huracanados en zonas concretas.
Había muy pocos sonidos de hormigas león existentes que aprovechar<sb>en <I>Half-Life: Alyx<I>. Al contrario que con la mayoría de las criaturas conocidas del universo <I>Half-Life<I>,<sb>que solían tener capas de sonidos preexistentes, casi todos los sonidos<sb>de estas criaturas son completamente nuevos.<sb>Empezamos con un lienzo casi en negro,<cr>así que nos inspiramos<sb>en el comportamiento de las hormigas león para dar forma a su diseño sonoro.<sb>Como las hormigas león atacan en grupo,<cr>nos pareció lógico<sb>que se comunicaran y organizaran colectivamente para atacar.<sb>Esta idea nos llevó a incorporar chasquidos de insectos más complejos,<sb>y la versión final comenzó con grabaciones de estorninos,<sb>que resultaron ser más variadas y complejas<cr>que las de insectos.<sb>Aquí puedes escuchar los sonidos<cr>de estornino originales.<sb><wait:13>Utilizamos esas grabaciones y las combinamos por capas con elementos diseñados para crear los sonidos de las hormigas león del juego.
En los juegos tradicionales, los controles analógicos como palancas, sintonizadores y manivelas<sb>tienen animaciones sencillas que reaccionan cuando un jugador hace clic con el ratón o<cr>pulsa una tecla.<sb>En la realidad virtual, los jugadores con mandos de seguimiento de manos esperan<sb>poder controlar las interfaces analógicas agarrándolas y moviéndolas directamente.<sb>Para ello, desarrollamos un nuevo sistema de animaciones interactivas.<sb>El mecanismo de acceso de esta estación de salud es un buen ejemplo.<sb>A tu izquierda y a tu derecha verás más ejemplos, como una enorme palanca de ferrocarril,<sb>el timbre de la alarma de incendios del vortigaunt, una manivela,<sb>una puerta de armario y la antena y el sintonizador de la radio.<sb>Estas animaciones interactivas nos permiten ofrecerles a los jugadores el control<sb>de las interfaces analógicas, pero limitado a un rango de movimiento predefinido.<sb>El sistema usa la posición y la orientación<cr>de la mano del jugador<sb>para reproducir la animación de un modelo que define la interfaz analógica.<sb>Conforme el jugador mueve el mando de seguimiento, el elemento interactivo realiza<sb>una búsqueda constante para determinar si reproducir la animación<sb>hacia delante o hacia atrás colocará el punto de interacción más cerca<sb>de la posición del mando de seguimiento<cr>en el espacio.<sb>Esto permite al jugador mover la animación hacia delante o hacia atrás, o mantenerla fija.<sb>El resultado es una conexión intuitiva entre el cuerpo del jugador y la interfaz virtual.<sb>Además, estas animaciones interactivas no tienen por qué tener sentido a nivel físico;<sb>los artistas se limitan a animar el rango de movimiento que quieren que el jugador controle.<sb>Estas animaciones interactivas tienen activadas las visualizaciones de depuración,<sb>así que podrás ver el rango de movimiento permitido, incluidas las rutas no lineales<sb>empleadas en la palanca del ferrocarril, la estación de salud y la manivela.<sb>Las animaciones interactivas nos permitieron hacer interactivos objetos del mundo de todo tipo,<sb>desde los dispositivos humanos más comunes hasta los mecanismos más complejos de la Alianza,<sb>sin tener que ejecutar<cr>simulaciones físicas enrevesadas.<sb>Antes de continuar, ¿por qué no pruebas las animaciones interactivas de esta zona?
En ocasiones, grandes partes de un nivel se cambian de lugar o se reordenan conforme trabajamos en el juego.<sb>Ese fue el caso de toda esta zona y la conexión eléctrica en la que se basa.<sb>De hecho, durante gran parte de su existencia, esta zona ni siquiera pertenecía a ningún lugar del juego<sb>y se había creado para diseñar prototipos de la mecánica de conexiones eléctricas.<sb>A lo largo de varios meses, se desarrollaron las mecánicas básicas<sb>de estos rompecabezas y se probaron en varios niveles de prueba pequeños.<sb>Cada uno de estos niveles<cr>exploraba una única idea.<sb>Por ejemplo, usar la conexión eléctrica para dirigir<sb>la atención del jugador hacia algo interesante, como la flora y la fauna de Xen...<sb>Crear momentos de sorpresa cuando un cangrejo enemigo aparecía de repente por un respiradero...<sb>O hacer que el jugador metiera el brazo y la mano detrás de tuberías u otros espacios estrechos.<sb>En cuanto vimos cuáles de estas ideas<cr>funcionaban bien, las combinamos<sb>para crear un solo nivel de prueba con una conexión eléctrica que aprovechaba<sb>todas estas ideas en un único rompecabezas.<sb>Las pruebas posteriores nos confirmaron que debíamos incluir<sb>las conexiones eléctricas en el juego, y empezamos a añadirlas en otras zonas,<sb>aunque no incluimos<cr>este nivel de prueba en ninguna.<sb>Fue más tarde cuando nos dimos cuenta de que el zoo necesitaba un pequeño momento de descanso.<sb>Durante las pruebas nos fijamos en el cansancio<cr>de los jugadores y buscamos<sb>momentos en los que usar un rompecabezas o la búsqueda de recursos<sb>para que el jugador descanse de tanto combate.<sb>Esto era especialmente necesario al final del nivel del zoo. Afortunadamente,<sb>pudimos usar el nivel del prototipo de conexión que ya se había construido.
Cuando decidimos rescatar el nivel del prototipo para usarlo como descanso<sb>del zoológico, tuvimos la oportunidad<cr>de realizar mejoras<sb>e integrar elementos que no existían la primera vez que experimentamos con esta mecánica.<sb>Por ejemplo, las ampollas explosivas de Xen recién desarrolladas se añadieron<sb>en varias partes del rompecabezas para sorprender a los jugadores y recordarles que deben estar al tanto de estos peligros.<sb>Durante los meses intermedios, la mecánica de la conexión había evolucionado<sb>de una en la que los jugadores solo tenían que empujar una bola de energía por un camino<sb>a otra que incluía bifurcaciones<cr>e intersecciones rotatorias.<sb>Esta intersección del panel de distribución eléctrica es el eje de todo el rompecabezas;<sb>el jugador debe interactuar con ella tres veces: una para abrir la puerta enrollable<sb>que lleva a esta zona trasera; otra para redirigir la energía de la puerta hacia el último tramo<sb>del rompecabezas y otra para volver a abrir<cr>la puerta y poder salir.<sb>Como esta conexión eléctrica abarca<cr>un espacio físico tan grande,<sb>que incluye combates contra zombis,<cr>los jugadores solían olvidar<sb>la relación entre el estado de esta intersección<cr>y la puerta enrollable.<sb>Como consecuencia, quedaban atrapados aquí sin saber cómo continuar.<sb>Para resolver este problema, realizamos muchos cambios en la presentación de esta intersección<cr>a lo largo del desarrollo.<sb>El aspecto único del panel y de los circuitos se diseñó para que fuera fácil<sb>reconocer esa intersección<cr>desde ambos lados del muro.<sb>La forma del agujero del muro y la orientación del panel de distribución eléctrica<sb>están diseñados para garantizar que el jugador está en una posición<sb>desde donde ve la puerta y que se cierra al desviar<sb>la energía hacia el último tramo del rompecabezas.<sb>La puerta también hace mucho ruido y echa una cantidad tremenda de chispas<sb>que llaman la atención cada vez que se mueve.<sb>Durante mucho tiempo pensamos en eliminar este rompecabezas concreto del juego,<sb>pero, tras pulirlo, suficientes jugadores de pruebas comprendían<sb>su funcionamiento como para incluirlo<cr>en el producto final.
La salida del zoológico nos dio la oportunidad de presentar a los jugadores<sb>un panorama dramático y mostrarles todo el progreso que habían realizado<cr>en su viaje hacia la bóveda.<sb>Esto supuso un desafío, porque ya habíamos decidido que la ubicación<sb>de la bóveda en el mundo<cr>estaría sobre el aparcamiento<sb>al que llegaría el jugador al final del mapa.<sb>Sin embargo, colocar la bóveda correctamente en esa ubicación hacía que pareciera<sb>demasiado distante y no creaba<cr>la impresión deseada.<sb>También queríamos enseñar aquí cómo los vortigaunts cortaban los cables eléctricos<sb>de la bóveda, pero, al situar esta escena<cr>en un lugar tan lejano,<sb>no resultaba clara y confundía<cr>a los jugadores de pruebas.<sb>La solución fue acercarlo todo.<sb>La bóveda tenía un aspecto más imponente y se cernía sobre jugador, y los efectos<sb>de los vortigaunts cortando los cables<cr>eran mucho más evidentes.<sb>Lo único que necesitábamos era un motivo que justificara las dos ubicaciones de la bóveda:<sb>esta, al comienzo del mapa, y la de más adelante, al final del mapa.<sb>Durante esta fase de desarrollo, estábamos tratando de definir<sb>exactamente cómo derribaría la bóveda el jugador, y nuestra solución<sb>a ese problema también nos sirvió para justificar<cr>las dos ubicaciones de la estructura.<sb>Los rayos tractores son todo un cliché<cr>de la ciencia ficción y suelen compartir<sb>un estilo visual común: un campo de fuerza envolvente que se emite como una red<cr>desde un único punto.<sb>Aquí, funcionó bien emplear un rayo tractor como dispositivo de seguridad de la Alianza<cr>para sostener la bóveda.<sb>Nos permitió impedir que Alyx quedara aplastada<cr>al caer la bóveda del cielo<sb>cuando los vortigaunts cortan el último cable eléctrico, y nos proporcionó<sb>una forma satisfactoria de mover la bóveda adonde necesitábamos que estuviera al final del mapa.<sb>A lo largo del mapa, el rayo también funciona como una especie de faro que garantiza<sb>que los jugadores reconozcan siempre su nuevo objetivo: la estación de control del rayo tractor.
El giro final del juego presentó varios desafíos narrativos a los guionistas.<sb>Este es un juego largo, mucho más que una película, y la revelación final<sb>de G-man parecía casi imposible de mantener en secreto durante la experiencia.<sb>Todos los miembros del equipo daban por hecho que la mayoría de los jugadores<sb>acabarían deduciéndolo sin esfuerzo conforme avanzaban en la historia.<sb>Al igual que en la mayoría de las historias bien contadas, la solución fue incluir más elementos:<sb>más detalles, más incógnitas y más complejidad<cr>en la trama.<sb>Los guionistas no tardaron mucho<cr>en percatarse de que había<sb>un nombre importante, Gordon Freeman,<cr>que atraía la atención<sb>de los jugadores y les hacía olvidar<cr>sus propias teorías.<sb>Entonces nos dimos cuenta de que podíamos usar la ausencia de G-man en la historia<sb>y los inquietantes paralelismos entre sus experiencias y las de Gordon<sb>en Black Mesa para redirigir la atención del jugador e impulsar la historia hacia el acto final.<sb>Si el jugador pensaba que había descubierto una misión nueva para salvar<sb>a Gordon Freeman de la estasis, entonces la sorpresa final estaría asegurada.<sb>Para lograrlo, los guionistas crearon un nuevo y misterioso personaje:<sb>una científica que colabora con la Alianza.<sb>Esto se añadió en las últimas fases del proyecto, así que los guionistas contaron<sb>con otro método eficaz: basar el personaje<cr>en una actriz que nos gustara<sb>y después hacer todo lo posible<cr>para contratarla y grabar con ella.<sb>Los guionistas eligieron una actriz que les gustó especialmente. Desprendía<sb>una confianza tranquila pero autoritaria y tenía un fluido acento de Misuri.<sb>Esto no solo sirve para distinguirla de otros personajes del universo <I>Half-Life<I>,<sb>sino también para "oír" mejor<cr>al personaje al escribirlo,<sb>algo muy importante cuando el tiempo apremia al final del proyecto.<sb>Ya en el estudio, su actuación fue impecable y sirvió para confirmar que habíamos tomado<cr>la decisión correcta.<sb>Aun así, todavía teníamos que crear la escena.<sb>Los diseñadores del nivel pensaron en qué parte de un nivel podrían insertar esta escena.<sb>La zona que habíamos escogido anteriormente tenía lapas y algunos elementos<sb>de rompecabezas fáciles que a los diseñadores no les importaba perder.<sb>Hubo que alterar esa parte del nivel para dirigir<cr>a un lugar donde pudiera<sb>desarrollarse la escena y el jugador pudiera escuchar sin ver claramente al personaje.<sb>Esto tenía dos fines: por un lado, que la escena fuera furtiva le daría más misterio<sb>y, por otro, se mantendría en secreto<cr>la identidad del personaje.<sb>Además, esto nos permitió sumir la actuación<cr>y la compleja animación facial<sb>necesarias para que un personaje cobre vida en las sombras para los animadores y coreógrafos.<sb>Como sucede en muchas ocasiones, trabajar <I>menos<I> resultó ser la decisión correcta<sb>para la historia <I>y<I> para nuestra apretada agenda.
El propósito de esta guarida fue<cr>premiar a los jugadores<sb>por ser observadores y explorar<cr>el entorno a conciencia.<sb>Queríamos destacar la historia de los carroñeros que vivían tras el muro de la cuarentena,<sb>contar cómo son sus vidas y<cr>por qué decidieron vivir allí.<sb>La persona que vivía aquí se conocía entre el equipo como "el asesino de la Alianza",<sb>a quien imaginábamos como alguien<cr>que odiaba a la Alianza,<sb>había elegido malvivir en la zona de cuarentena<sb>y dedicarse a desquitarse con<cr>las incautas patrullas de la Alianza<sb>y quizá terminaría por<cr>unirse al movimiento de resistencia<sb>organizado que aparece en <I>Half-Life 2<I>.
En los últimos años, la retransmisión de videojuegos se ha convertido en<cr>una de las principales formas<sb>de los usuarios para entrar en contacto con la cultura de los juegos, especialmente en el caso<sb>de la realidad virtual, ya que los jugadores que no tienen este tipo de dispositivos<cr>también quieren participar.<sb>Para incluir a este sector, hemos creado<cr>una interfaz de espectador que muestra<sb>la salud del jugador de realidad virtual, además de la munición, la resina y el contenido<cr>de los bolsillos de las muñecas.<sb>Esta información aparece sobre la vista 3D de la ventana del escritorio y permite<sb>que los espectadores sepan el estado<cr>de los recursos del jugador sin tener<sb>que esperar a que este mire su muñeca<cr>o abra un menú.<sb>La interfaz de espectador comenzó como una herramienta del equipo de desarrollo<sb>para ver recursos, además del estado de los botones del mando<sb>y otra información de diagnóstico.<sb>Una consecuencia interesante de esta interfaz<cr>fue que ver pruebas del juego<sb>se volvió mucho más emocionante;<cr>como público, poseíamos información<sb>de la que el jugador no tenía por qué ser consciente.<sb>Por ejemplo, los espectadores de pruebas pueden saber que alguien ha sobrevivido<sb>a un encuentro a duras penas aunque el jugador<cr>ni haya comprobado su salud.<sb>Incluso hubo casos en los que los jugadores mataban a un enemigo con su última bala<cr>sin ser conscientes de ello.<sb>Los puntos fuertes y débiles que observamos durante las pruebas fueron algo<sb>que queríamos compartir con el público de las retransmisiones, y nos encanta ver cómo se utiliza.
Crear una batalla culminante que ponga fin al combate con las hormigas león<sb>presentó un gran problema de diseño.<sb>Queríamos crear una experiencia de combate continua que resultase suficientemente significativa<sb>como para desafiar a los jugadores que habían perfeccionado sus habilidades<cr>contra las hormigas león.<sb>Sin embargo, no bastaba con enfrentar al jugador con un montón de hormigas león a la vez;<sb>no era una experiencia muy estimulante,<sb>ni era compatible con el equilibrio<cr>de combate establecido.<sb>En lugar de aislar al jugador en un espacio limitado y generar hordas de enemigos,<sb>queríamos mantener la motivación y fomentar el movimiento<sb>ejerciendo presión constante para lograr un objetivo.<sb>Para ello, necesitábamos una zona con un ritmo claro y lineal y un diseño poroso<sb>que permitiera al jugador<cr>no perder de vista su objetivo<sb>mientras lo rodeaban enjambres<cr>de hormigas león por el camino.<sb>Esta zona con vagones cisterna, que habíamos construido originalmente para una escena narrativa<sb>que acabamos quitando del juego, tenía todos los elementos que buscábamos.<sb>Los vagones de esta zona llevan a la dirección deseada y su posición<sb>obliga al jugador a prestar mucha atención<sb>a los lados y a la retaguardia mientras avanza.<sb>La torre del rayo tractor de la Alianza está<cr>al final de las vías<sb>y ofrece un objetivo claro al jugador.<sb>Colocar el cartel rojo brillante en la dirección del rayo tractor también fue<sb>una decisión deliberada. Es una técnica empleada por diseñadores de entornos<sb>para atraer subconscientemente a los jugadores hacia una dirección valiéndose del contraste visual,<sb>incluso aunque se desorienten momentáneamente durante un combate.<sb>El ritmo del combate aquí se equilibró meticulosamente para poner contra las cuerdas<sb>a la mayoría de los jugadores de pruebas<cr>y que sintieran que salían<sb>adelante por los pelos.<sb>Para lograr este equilibrio hicieron falta muchas pruebas ajustando la ruta del jugador<sb>y cambiando la ubicación de enemigos,<cr>munición y objetos.<sb>Finalmente, nos quedamos con un diseño<cr>que ofrecía un flujo constante<sb>de hormigas león; las que escupen se colocaron en el extremo del espacio<sb>para ejercer suficiente presión como para impedir que los jugadores corran hasta el objetivo.<sb>Los soldados de la Alianza de las plataformas elevadas desvían la atención del jugador<sb>hacia el flanco derecho y ofrecen verticalidad<cr>a la hora de priorizar los blancos.<sb>Esto añade la sensación de caos<cr>que buscábamos transmitir.
El objetivo de este rompecabezas era crear<cr>un momento de estrés intenso<sb>pidiendo a los jugadores que se ocuparan de<cr>una amenaza repentina<sb>tras colocarlos en una posición de gran desventaja.<sb>En el diseño original del rompecabezas, los jugadores se encontraban sobre una plataforma<sb>que colgaba de un cable y avanzaban por el abismo.<sb>A mitad del camino, aparecían hormigas león que escupen y empezaban a atacar.<sb>La plataforma ofrecía pocos lugares<cr>donde ponerse a cubierto,<sb>y los jugadores debían abandonarlos<cr>de vez en cuando para seguir avanzando.<sb>Esto nos ayudó a crear<cr>los momentos intensos que queríamos,<sb>pero, desgraciadamente, el movimiento lateral<cr>de la plataforma<sb>mareaba a la mayoría de los jugadores de pruebas.<sb>Incluso los jugadores a los que no incomodaba el movimiento vertical de los ascensores<sb>en otras partes del juego se mareaban aquí.<sb>El rompecabezas de la versión final mantiene<cr>el mismo grado de tensión<sb>porque se encuentra en un abismo durante un ataque, pero no requiere desplazar<cr>físicamente al jugador.<sb>La parte superior de la plataforma de madera<cr>no permite ponerse a cubierto;<sb>es una decisión intencionada para animar a los jugadores a saltar a las plataformas inferiores.<sb>En las plataformas inferiores hay suficientes lugares seguros para protegerse<sb>de las hormigas león, pero, al ser un abismo, la sensación de vulnerabilidad permanece.<sb>Aquí las protecciones son porosas y pueden romperse, lo que aumenta la sensación de urgencia<sb>y requiere que los jugadores ataquen a las hormigas león desde una posición comprometida.
En casos en los que los jugadores de pruebas tenían que enfrentarse a la Alianza<sb>en espacios relativamente abiertos, como este, vimos que solían regresar<sb>a un lugar seguro para intentar atacar<cr>a los soldados desde lejos.<sb>Los jugadores de pruebas lograban despejar<cr>la zona de combate,<sb>pero no se sentían satisfechos<cr>con el enfrentamiento<sb>por haber usado una estrategia repetitiva y estática.<sb>Por ello, recurrimos a varias herramientas de diseño para disuadir a los jugadores<cr>de usar estas tácticas.<sb>La posición del supresor de la Alianza, situado en la plataforma del camión,<sb>a un extremo del patio, es clave para lograr el ritmo que queríamos para esta batalla.<sb>El supresor no se moverá de su posición establecida en el extremo<sb>del patio mientras el jugador esté<cr>en el lado más cercano.<sb>Su posición, junto con su implacable<cr>fuego de supresión,<sb>obligan al jugador a avanzar para acercarse<cr>y poder liquidarlo<sb>mientras se somete<cr>a una intensa presión provocada<sb>por una combinación estratégica<cr>de otras unidades de la Alianza.<sb>Además, si el jugador se aleja<cr>demasiado del combate,<sb>los soldados de la Alianza con mayor movilidad del enfrentamiento se retirarán<sb>y se quedarán quietos hasta que<cr>el jugador vuelva a acercarse.<sb>Todos estos elementos fomentan que<cr>los jugadores se acerquen a lugares<sb>que ofrecen oportunidades más interesantes tanto para él como para los soldados enemigos.
Tras el intenso combate que la precede,<cr>esta torre es una especie<sb>de respiro antes de volver a aumentar<cr>la intensidad en la batalla final<sb>del jugador para llegar a los controles<cr>el rayo tractor de la Alianza.<sb>Aunque hay combates en la parte inferior<cr>de la torre, se ha diseñado<sb>para que los jugadores aprovechen el espacio<sb>de forma distinta que en la pelea anterior en el patio.<sb>Lo principal aquí es recorrer<cr>la verticalidad de la torre en todo su caos,<sb>lo cual funcionó muy bien en realidad virtual con los jugadores de pruebas.<sb>Las robosierras que atacan inicialmente al jugador desde arriba tienen una trayectoria<sb>que hace que terminen estrellándose contra<cr>las tuberías y planchas superiores,<sb>provocando que caigan chispas y astillas<cr>sobre el jugador.<sb>El supresor de la Alianza que sale de la parte superior de las escaleras,<sb>junto con la confusa naturaleza del espacio,<cr>sirve para reintroducir un nivel<sb>de intensidad adecuado, y también para crear una sensación de dificultad conforme el jugador<cr>se acerca más a su objetivo.
Al comienzo del mapa interior<cr>introducimos el rayo tractor,<sb>un dispositivo de seguridad que sirvió<cr>para sostener la bóveda caída<sb>cuando se destruyó la última subestación.<sb>En este lugar, parece que la consola<cr>pueda usarse para controlar<sb>el rayo tractor y acoplar la bóveda con la estructura de la izquierda para acceder a ella.<sb>Decidimos hacer que la bóveda cayera al suelo<cr>de forma espectacular,<sb>pero, para que esto funcionara a nivel emocional, antes había que aumentar la tensión de la escena.<sb>La consola de acoplamiento de la bóveda<cr>es absurda aposta.<sb>Si la consola se asemejara demasiado<cr>a un rompecabezas,<sb>los jugadores podrían perder demasiado tiempo<cr>y echar a perder la tensión<sb>del momento sin saber si había algo que resolver.<sb>Cuanto más inescrutable pareciera la máquina,<cr>más probable sería que interactuasen<sb>con las palancas y participen en el desastre. La primera parte del rompecabezas extiende la pasarela y desbloquea el panel<sb>de palancas principal que reacciona a los comandos del jugador<cr>para que se involucre en la solución.<sb>Las demás palancas no hacen nada<cr>excepto aumentar la tensión<sb>mientras la situación<cr>empeora gradualmente.<sb>El diálogo por radio entre Alyx y Russell<cr>completa la escena<sb>aumentando la sensación de pánico<cr>y mantiene al jugador centrado,<sb>moviendo palancas para intentar salvar la bóveda.
Hace cinco años, pusimos a jugadores de pruebas debajo de un zancudo de <I>Half-Life 2<I> inactivo.<sb>Era un prototipo muy sencillo, pero la respuesta fue increíblemente favorable.<sb>Esta experiencia nos convenció de que debíamos incluir un encuentro con un zancudo<cr>en realidad virtual.<sb>Como resultado, en los años posteriores creamos montones de prototipos.<sb>Algunos diseños hacían que los jugadores de pruebas estuvieran muy cerca del zancudo.<sb>En otros, este los perseguía por un entorno muy simple o les disparaba a través de<cr>protecciones porosas.<sb>En otros casos, el zancudo destruía un muro<cr>tras el que se ocultaba<sb>el jugador o actuaba de una forma<cr>que había que observar.<sb>Un prototipo creado en 2017 enfrentaba al jugador directamente al zancudo<sb>en una cantera y combinaba en una sola experiencia muchas de nuestras ideas.<sb>Basándose en el éxito de este prototipo,<cr>el equipo siguió creando<sb>la experiencia que ahora tienes frente a ti, aunque perfeccionarla nos llevaría tres años más.<sb>Cada repetición nos ofrecía un conjunto nuevo de reglas y expectativas de los jugadores.<sb>El siguiente encuentro con el zancudo es una recopilación de momentos<cr>creados meticulosamente,<sb>basados en lo que nos parecía emocionante y divertido y perfeccionados tras muchas pruebas.
Tras muchas versiones<cr>del encuentro con el zancudo,<cr>descubrimos que habíamos resuelto<sb>un problema, pero ahora teníamos<cr>que contextualizar<sb>la solución para que tuviera sentido en la narración.<sb>Por ejemplo, diseñamos todo este mapa para incluir combates contra soldados de la Alianza,<sb>pero ¿qué motivo tenían para encontrarse en este espacio destruido?<sb>¿Cómo colocamos un zancudo inactivo cerca del jugador?<sb>¿Qué hacía la Alianza aquí antes de que cayera la bóveda?<sb>Colocamos a este soldado aquí para informar al jugador de que había miembros de la Alianza<sb>investigando una plaga de hormigas león en la zona antes de la caída de la bóveda.<sb>De hecho, puedes ver hormigas león muertas<cr>por aquí cerca.<sb>Si escuchas con atención, oirás al soldado intentando contactar con el resto de su batallón.<sb>Esto sirve para que el jugador sepa que no está solo y que es probable que tenga que luchar.
Aunque en esta zona podíamos justificar que hubiera algunos miembros de la Alianza<sb>investigando la plaga de hormigas león,<cr>había que buscar un pretexto<sb>para los grandes batallones de la Alianza de los futuros enfrentamientos del nivel.<sb>Estos dos soldados son parte de un batallón desplegado para buscar supervivientes<sb>tras la caída de la bóveda. El diálogo está diseñado para informar al jugador<sb>de que el zancudo que han encontrado<cr><I>tal vez no esté muerto<I>.<sb>En la historia, el combate del jugador contra estos dos soldados es lo que alerta<sb>al resto de la Alianza de la zona<cr>de que el jugador está aquí.
Para muchos jugadores, los zancudos son los enemigos más temibles y poderosos<sb>de la saga <I>Half-Life<I>,<cr>y pensamos que sería interesante<sb>hacer algo que los jugadores no se esperen y experimentar cómo sería unir fuerzas<cr>con un zancudo.<sb>Nuestro concepto inicial se inspiró en la fábula de <I>El león y el ratón<I> de Esopo.<sb>El jugador liberaría a un zancudo inactivo que después lo ayudaría a escapar<cr>despejándole el camino.<sb>En un principio, el aparcamiento era un silo de la Alianza y narrativamente era mucho más sencillo<sb>usar un dispositivo de la Alianza que pudiera reducir a un zancudo sin causarle daños.<sb>Cuando la ubicación pasó a ser<cr>un aparcamiento derrumbado, redujimos<sb>al zancudo atrapándolo en el hueco del ascensor, reteniéndolo con el propio ascensor.<sb>Tras liberarse, el zancudo herido atacaba a cualquier cosa que tuviera cerca,<sb>ya fuese el jugador o un miembro de la Alianza, mientras intentaba huir.<sb>Esta historia funcionaba muy bien a nivel narrativo, pero era difícil contarla<sb>de forma que los jugadores la comprendieran.<sb>A los jugadores de pruebas les confundía la presencia constante del zancudo<sb>en el nivel, alternando entre un estado herido y otro enfadado, mientras se abrían camino<sb>por el aparcamiento, y nos costó mucho encontrar el equilibrio adecuado.<sb>Las opiniones de los jugadores de pruebas<cr>no cambiaban, de modo que,<sb>aunque la idea nos encantaba,<cr>finalmente optamos por un enfoque<sb>más directo y factible: la dinámica de <I>cazador y presa<I> que terminó en el producto final.<sb>El año invertido alrededor de la idea de <I>El león y el ratón<I> no cayó en saco roto;<sb>nos sirvió para crear y pulir muchas de las partes narrativas que acabaron en el juego.<sb>Además, creamos actuaciones y tecnología que contribuyeron al éxito de la experiencia final.
El encuentro con el zancudo se reduce a un conjunto de movimientos y su ametralladora, impulsada por la IA.<sb>Mantener la ilusión de que el zancudo era consciente de la presencia del jugador<sb>y lo estaba persiguiendo con estos movimientos requirió una meticulosa coordinación<cr>entre la animación y la IA.<sb>Empleamos varios métodos para asegurarnos de que el zancudo parecía una criatura inteligente que quería cazar al jugador.<sb>En realidad virtual, los jugadores se mueven más despacio que en otros juegos<sb>de disparos en primera persona,<cr>así que hicimos que el zancudo<sb>alternase entre un modo de persecución<cr>y otro de caza,<sb>entre perseguir al jugador por el nivel<cr>y buscarlo para dispararle.<sb>Hicieron falta muchas pruebas para diseñar las diferentes etapas de esta persecución.<sb>Nos centramos en cómo se movían<cr>los jugadores de pruebas por el nivel,<sb>creamos los desencadenantes y repetimos las animaciones para cimentar<cr>los comportamientos más habituales.<sb>Hacer que un momento concreto hiciera que la mayoría de los jugadores creyera<sb>que el zancudo iba tras ellos<cr>requirió mucho tira y afloja.<sb>Los primeros jugadores de pruebas se cansaban de recibir disparos sin ninguna pausa<sb>ni contraste entre experiencias, así que identificamos las partes que crearían<sb>ese contraste y las integramos<cr>donde se agotaban los jugadores.<sb>Cosas como que el zancudo destrozara una pared, se acercara o te persiguiera<sb>por el hueco de un ascensor servían para segmentar la experiencia y sorprender al jugador.<sb>Cada vez que un jugador de pruebas se aburría o se cansaba, pensábamos<sb>en cómo insertar estos momentos<cr>y después los probábamos<sb>para asegurarnos de que el ritmo era el adecuado.<sb>Una de las herramientas que empleamos fue un sofisticado sistema de rastreo integrado<cr>en el zancudo.<sb>Este sistema detectaba al jugador y orientaba distintas partes del zancudo hacia él.<sb>El cuerpo, la ametralladora y el cañón de Gauss rastreaban al jugador<sb>por separado para interrumpir el efecto al encontrarlo o perderlo.<sb>Estos podían activarse o desactivarse independientemente en momentos determinados<sb>para crear la impresión de que el zancudo<cr>se dirigía directamente al jugador.<sb>En cada animación de la secuencia, los rastreadores de la ametralladora y el cuerpo<sb>se activaban o desactivaban dependiendo de si el zancudo debería poder ver al jugador o no.
Era muy importante transmitir<cr>con claridad al jugador que,<sb>en ese momento, el zancudo lo estaba persiguiendo.<sb>Queríamos que los jugadores vieran al zancudo poniéndose en marcha y centrándose<sb>en ellos como objetivo, para que no hubiera ninguna duda de que ahora eran su presa.<sb>Este momento en el ascensor fue muy útil<cr>para lograrlo, puesto que es<sb>uno de los pocos momentos del juego en los que el jugador solo puede observar.<sb>La puerta del ascensor frente al zancudo<cr>se creó para ofrecer<sb>suficiente protección como para que<cr>los jugadores se sintieran a salvo,<sb>pero con suficiente visibilidad para ver los movimientos del zancudo.
Durante el desarrollo, hablamos largo y tendido sobre la experiencia de la ametralladora<cr>del zancudo<sb>destrozando las paredes y suelos del aparcamiento<sb>mientras perseguía al jugador, pero no tuvimos claro si podríamos ofrecer<sb>una protección destruible<cr>hasta seis meses antes del lanzamiento.<sb>Para solucionarlo, diseñamos la protección destruible de forma<sb>que transmitiera visualmente que se iba a romper<sb>antes de empezar a agrietarse y quebrarse.<sb>Inicialmente, la protección parecía un trozo de cemento común o cualquier otro<sb>material de construcción. Sin embargo, tras sufrir daños considerables,<sb>comenzaba a agrietarse y soltar polvo.<sb>Cuando esa misma protección sufría más daños,<cr>se rompía en trozos más pequeños y<sb>generaba más polvo y escombros.<sb>Las pruebas nos sirvieron para determinar la cantidad de daño que podría soportar<sb>la protección antes de destruirse y así<cr>obligar al jugador a avanzar.<sb>Al final, el sistema de protecciones destruibles<sb>nos permitió dar a los jugadores<sb>la impresión de que el zancudo podía destrozar<sb>el aparcamiento con su ametralladora<cr>mientras los perseguía.
En esta zona del mapa, algunos jugadores de pruebas nos dijeron<sb>que los disparos de la ametralladora les resultaban tediosos.<sb>La idea original era que esta arma disparase a un ritmo constante con independencia de lo que hiciera el jugador.<sb>Para que fuera menos monótono, realizamos varias mejoras<sb>en la IA del zancudo cuando usaba solo la ametralladora.<sb>La ametralladora dispara si ve al jugador, pero tarda un poco en localizarlo,<sb>emite un sonido para advertir de que lo ha encontrado<sb>y después dispara una primera ráfaga de balazos al jugador.<sb>Añadimos una pausa entre ráfagas para dar una mayor sensación de caos,<sb>con intervalos aleatorios entre ellas.<sb>Si el jugador se pone a cubierto, el zancudo sigue disparando<sb>durante unos instantes hacia el último lugar donde vio al jugador.<sb>Estos cambios en la ametralladora eliminaron la monotonía y dieron<sb>a los jugadores la sensación de que se enfrentaban a un ser vivo.
Para que el enfrentamiento con el zancudo siguiera siendo interesante durante todo el nivel,<sb>queríamos desafiar los esquemas que<cr>el jugador se había creado<sb>sobre lo que es capaz de hacer esta criatura.<sb>Identificamos la siguiente sala como un espacio donde la mayoría de los jugadores<sb>pensarían que conocían<cr>las capacidades del zancudo<sb>y creamos la próxima parte para sorprenderlos.<sb>Para crear el momento con el marco de la puerta, usamos la animación del zancudo<sb>para ejecutar una simulación<cr>de destrucción independiente<sb>que pudiera reproducirse en tiempo real<cr>con el motor del juego.<sb>A esto le sumamos efectos<cr>de partículas e impulsos físicos<sb>en objetos físicos interactivos de la sala para que<cr>el jugador no se sintiera a salvo.<sb>Para convencer al jugador de que<cr>el zancudo lo estaba buscando<sb>y lo había encontrado,<cr>hicimos que el zancudo se detuviera un instante<sb>tras destrozar el muro y observara al jugador<cr>justo antes de volver a disparar.
Cuando probamos el enfrentamiento con el zancudo, descubrimos que<cr>a los jugadores les gustaba<sb>luchar contra un enemigo difícil,<cr>pero reaccionaban negativamente<sb>si sufrían daño de forma que les pareciera injusta.<sb>Para resolver este problema, utilizamos sonidos que informaban del estado del zancudo.<sb>Por ejemplo, cuando el jugador no estaba<cr>en el campo visual del zancudo,<sb>este emitía un sonido intermitente de caza.<sb><wait:1.9>Este sonido servía para informar al jugador de que estaba a salvo en ese momento,<sb>pero el zancudo seguía cerca.<sb>En cuanto el zancudo localizaba al jugador, pasaba<sb>al modo de persecución y emitía<cr>los sonidos correspondientes.<sb><wait:3.5>Cuando el zancudo estaba listo para empezar a disparar al jugador,<sb>emitía un sonido de "objetivo localizado"<cr>antes de atacar.<sb><wait:2>Los jugadores no tardaron en aprender<cr>el patrón de sonidos y dejaron<sb>de quejarse de que el zancudo los pillara desprevenidos.
Debíamos familiarizar al jugador con la secuencia de disparos del cañón de Gauss del zancudo<sb>para que pudiera reconocerlo cuando lo viera posteriormente en el mapa.<sb>Repetimos muchas veces<cr>esta zona concreta del mapa,<sb>buscando formas de colocar al jugador<cr>en el lugar y momento<sb>adecuados para que viera lo que debía:<sb>el cañón de Gauss cargándose y disparando.<sb>Para lograrlo, optamos por usar una puerta enrollable que se abre con ambas manos.<sb>Esto obliga al jugador a colocarse en una posición<cr>y orientación concretas,<sb>y al tener las manos ocupadas nos aseguramos de que no se teletransporta ni interactúa con otra cosa.<sb>Incluso sabemos en qué momento preciso la puerta deja de cubrir la vista del jugador,<sb>por lo que sabemos que verá<cr>lo que queremos que vea.
Cuando el tema central de este mapa<cr>era El león y el ratón,<sb>el encuentro con el zancudo<cr>terminaba en este momento.<sb>El zancudo se limitaba<cr>a desaparecer por el horizonte.<sb>Nuestra intención era que el zancudo<cr>regresara en un combate posterior,<sb>tal vez incluso que atacara a la Alianza<cr>junto al jugador,<sb>pero no tardamos mucho en descartar la idea.<sb>El problema era que a los jugadores de pruebas<cr>no les parecía justo<sb>no poder liquidar al zancudo después de que este los hubiera estado persiguiendo tanto tiempo.<sb>En el último mapa, cuando el jugador se introduce en el laberinto inferior,<sb>el zancudo reaparece y vuelve a perseguirlo.<sb>Como Alyx no tiene ninguna arma<cr>que pueda dañar al zancudo,<sb>pensamos en cómo podría eliminar el jugador<sb>a esta criatura valiéndose de algo<cr>que estuviera en el entorno.<sb>Se nos ocurrieron varias ideas, como activar los misiles de un helicóptero derribado de la Alianza,<sb>aprovechar la ubicación de un mortero de la Alianza o desencadenar<sb>algún evento físico para hacer que el zancudo cayera y así matarlo.<sb>Creamos prototipos de muchas de estas ideas<cr>y al final<sb>decidimos usar el lanzagranadas fijo<sb>que aparece en el juego.<sb>Era algo simple, fácil de repetir y una de las soluciones más sencillas para instruir<cr>a los jugadores bajo presión.
En esta secuencia, queríamos que el jugador finalizara el enfrentamiento liquidando<sb>al zancudo en una espectacular lucha<cr>con un arma del entorno.<sb>Eso implicaba introducir un arma nueva que fuera<sb>más poderosa que las del jugador y que permaneciera en el entorno<sb>una vez que el combate hubiera terminado.<sb>Un arma fija en un vehículo abandonado de la Alianza era lo que tenía más sentido.<sb>Tras unas cuantas pruebas iniciales con un helicóptero de la Alianza<sb>derribado, reaprovechado de <I>Half-Life 2<I>,<sb>optamos por el transporte blindado de tropas,<sb>pues ya se había construido uno<cr>para otra sección del juego.<sb>Como el jugador tendría que usar<cr>esta arma por primera vez<sb>mientras el zancudo lo ataca,<cr>debía tener un mecanismo<sb>de puntería y disparo que pudiera<cr>comprenderse de inmediato.<sb>Fuimos probando varios diseños, desde una ametralladora que disparaba automáticamente<sb>en cuanto el jugador la cogía hasta una pistola<cr>que disparaba una bomba lapa<sb>que el jugador debía detonar<cr>después de alcanzar al objetivo.<sb>La ametralladora con disparo automático resultaba demasiado simple y no aportaba suficiente tensión,<sb>y la interacción necesaria<cr>para detonar la bomba lapa<sb>era demasiado compleja para explicársela<cr>al jugador bajo presión.<sb>Finalmente, optamos por un diseño<cr>que requiere una mano<sb>para apuntar y otra para recargar y disparar.<sb>Hacer que el jugador tenga que empujar el mecanismo de disparo hasta el final<sb>para recargar era necesario para evitar<cr>que disparase demasiado rápido.<sb>La animación de recarga de la munición se activa directamente con el movimiento<sb>que realiza el jugador,<cr>para que entienda que debe mover<sb>la mano hasta el final para recargar el arma antes de poder retirarla para disparar.
El jugador pierde el contacto con Russell<cr>al entrar en la bóveda<sb>y verse inmerso en esa realidad distorsionada.<sb>Como Russell ya no puede explicarle<cr>al jugador lo que ve,<sb>teníamos que reflejar los conceptos más importantes de la bóveda mediante<sb>el uso de efectos visuales, la física,<cr>el diseño de sonido y la música.<sb>El concepto más importante fue que los estallidos espontáneos de energía descontrolada<sb>que causaban eventos antirrealidad eran una consecuencia de la energía de vortigaunt<sb>que se usaba para mantener al prisionero<cr>en la bóveda, ya que su influencia<sb>lograba imponerse ocasionalmente mediante<cr>las grietas en el campo.<sb>Desde la caída de la bóveda en el mapa anterior, usamos esta pieza de diseño<sb>de sonido musical para representar<cr>la energía de vortigaunt descontrolada<sb>emergiendo de la bóveda.<sb><wait:5>Y esta pieza<sb><wait:2>para acompañar los estallidos que alteran<cr>la realidad provocados<sb>e influenciados por el creciente control de G-man.<sb>En el interior de la bóveda, repetimos estos motivos para reforzar la mecánica<sb>de energía de vortigaunt que el jugador<cr>podrá emplear como arma<sb>contra la Alianza para liberar al prisionero,<cr>salvar a Eli y completar el juego.
Desde que comenzamos a diseñar la historia<cr>del juego, el equipo de sonido<sb>trazó un plan estético correspondiente que emplease un diseño de sonido,<sb>paisajes acústicos y música cada vez más estrambóticos para culminar con un paisaje acústico<sb>adecuado a la realidad quebrada de la bóveda<cr>y el encuentro de Alyx con G-man.<sb>Conforme diseñábamos el nivel de la bóveda, resultó evidente que la música<sb>de acompañamiento sería fundamental para reflejar la naturaleza surrealista del lugar.<sb>La mayoría de la música de la bóveda se basa en el palíndromo musical que se oye<cr>en la habitación ladeada.<sb><wait:48>Utilizando variaciones de elementos de esta pieza y distorsionándolos con varios tipos<sb>de curvaturas temporales y tonales, obtuvimos una sonoridad abstracta adecuada.<sb><wait:22>Aunque es extraña y descoloca,<cr>también es coherente consigo misma,<sb>y a nivel conceptual relevante respecto a<cr>la naturaleza multidimensional<sb>de G-man y de la energía de vortigaunt<cr>que lo tiene prisionero.
<I>Half-Life: Alyx<I> tiene lugar en un mundo realista<cr>con reglas familiares.<sb>La presencia de G-man en la bóveda nos dio<cr>una justificación dentro de la historia<sb>para experimentar con<cr>varias distorsiones de realidad<sb>y recurrir al surrealismo en estos espacios.<sb>Los experimentos iniciales<cr>con anomalías gravitatorias y distorsiones<cr>de las expectativas especiales<sb>fueron prometedoras, ya que la realidad virtual resaltaba el impacto que causaban.<sb>Los entornos surrealistas también demostraron un buen entorno para los rompecabezas,<sb>pero ralentizaban el ritmo del juego en un momento<sb>en el que debía acelerar,<cr>así que no se incluyeron en la versión final.<sb>El ejemplo más notable fue la vivienda espejada.<sb>Originalmente, los jugadores debían encontrar<cr>y corregir las diferencias<sb>entre el espacio inferior y el superior<cr>para escapar de la zona.<sb>En lugar de incluir rompecabezas interactivos surrealistas, la primera mitad<cr>de la bóveda se convirtió<sb>en una aventura por un conjunto de espacios <cr>cada vez más extraños<sb>que habían sido el edificio donde<cr>G-man había sido capturado.
Sobrecargar los Russells con energía de vortigaunt nos ayudó a hacer que<sb>un jugador desarmado logre superar<cr>a los últimos soldados de la Alianza<sb>en pie<cr>que custodiaban a G-man.<sb>Inicialmente, lo logramos con granadas<cr>y un pasillo sin gravedad.<sb>Además de eso, habíamos probado a hacer que<cr>los Russells extrajeran<sb>y lanzaran rayos de energía de nodos<cr>de energía de vortigaunt.<sb>Encajaba bien en la sección de combate<cr>de la bóveda, ya que recuerda<sb>a la idea de sobrecargar la pistola antigravedad<cr>al final de <I>Half-Life 2<I><sb>y aprovecha la mecánica de lanzamiento<cr>de los Russells que el jugador ya domina.<sb>Esta nueva mecánica se introdujo en un momento en el que el ritmo es fundamental,<sb>así que debía ser fácil de aprender y de dominar.<sb>Darle al jugador el ataque de energía de vortigaunt no solo ayudaba a dejar claro<sb>que esta energía se usaba para contener a G-man,<sb>sino que también consolidaba la profunda conexión de los vortigaunts con Alyx.<sb>También le daba al jugador la oportunidad de sentir por un momento que tiene superpoderes<sb>y de usar esa habilidad de una forma visceral<sb>y muy física que resultaría imposible en la vida real.
Queríamos darle un toque dramático<cr>a nivel musical a la primera vez<sb>que el jugador se acerca la jaula,<cr>el objetivo de su larga misión, y la contempla,<sb>aunque debía ser inquietante y coherente<cr>con la experiencia en el resto de la bóveda.<sb>Seguimos empleando variaciones de los elementos musicales oídos anteriormente,<sb>pero con mayor nitidez y menos abstractos.<sb>Al igual que en piezas musicales previas, los elementos de cuerda distorsionados se extraen<sb>del palíndromo musical<cr>que se oye en la habitación ladeada,<sb>pero están desencajados, desarmonizados<cr>y yuxtapuestos<sb>para reflejar la colisión de diferentes realidades<cr>y líneas temporales.<sb><wait:19>Conforme el jugador se acerca a la jaula,<cr>se introduce una pieza de piano<sb>que funciona con las tres, casi uniéndolas entre sí, pero también separándolas,<sb>del mismo modo que G-man une los varios hilos<cr>y eras de la saga <I>Half-Life<I>.<sb><wait:40>
Cuanto más surrealista se volvía la situación<cr>en la bóveda, más difícil resultaba diseñar<sb>rompecabezas que fueran abstractos pero comprensibles al mismo tiempo.<sb>Durante las pruebas, descubrimos que<cr>en esta parte del juego<sb>los jugadores ansiaban un desenlace narrativo,<cr>y más rompecabezas podían resultar frustrantes.<sb>Tras experimentar con interacciones más complejas, optamos por una presentación<sb>más teatral del momento<cr>en el que el jugador libera a G-man.<sb>Simplificamos el diseño a una única interacción<cr>del jugador agarrando cables<sb>por dos puntos y devolviendo la energía de vortigaunt al sistema, destruyendo así<sb>la estructura donde estaba prisionero G-man.<sb>El final no se completó hasta la última etapa<cr>del proceso, ya que todos<sb>los elementos artísticos, narrativos, de diseño de niveles, interactivos y musicales<sb>debían estar listos para que el conjunto funcionara.<sb>En cualquier caso, nos sentimos muy satisfechos con el resultado, y la reacción de los jugadores<cr>ha sido extremadamente favorable.
