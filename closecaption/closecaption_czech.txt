Unable To Start Game
A game file appears to be missing or corrupted.  In the Steam client go to the game's properties.  In the 'Local Files' tab select 'Verify Integrity of Game Cache' to have Steam double-check the game's installation.
The system ran out of memory while loading the game.
Unable to find a valid Direct 3D device!
Check that your graphics driver is working properly,
and that you satisfy the minspecs of the game you are playing.
Your graphics card falls below our official minimum specs,
which have not been changed in the transition to Dota 2 Reborn.
When running under the Source 1 engine, that did not prevent
the game from working because the engine was not designed around
the full capabilities of the minimum spec for graphic cards.
However, Dota 2 Reborn relies on graphics features such as vertex textures and shader model 3.0
and so adherence to the minimum spec is a stronger requirement
than it was in Source 1 Dota 2. Unfortunately this means that Dota 2 Reborn
will not be able to run on some graphics cards from 2006 or before.
You might be using an old version of fraps which is incompatible with the game. Upgrade to Version 3.5.99 Build 15623 or later.
Error creating a D3D device! This can occur because of incompatibility with some 3rd party applications.
Change Rendering API
The game has detected that changing the rendering API to %s1 should increase your frame rate.
Changing this setting requires restarting the game, though, so approving the change means the game will exit this launch and try to restart after clicking yes.
Do you want the game to switch to the suggested rendering API?
If the game does not start properly after this change you can add -safe_mode to your launch options to override the change.
You can also change the rendering API setting later in the video settings.
Yes
OpenGL Support for Windows DLC required for OpenGL (-gl) mode.
Please download the OpenGL DLC and restart.
Failed to create an OpenGL context.
Your graphics card must support at least OpenGL v%s1.
Required OpenGL extension "%s1" is not supported.  Please update your OpenGL driver.
Vulkan Support DLC required for Vulkan (-vulkan) mode.
Please download the Vulkan DLC and restart.
Vulkan on macOS requires macOS v%s1 or greater.
Failed to initialize Vulkan.
Please make sure your driver and GPU support Vulkan.
To disable Vulkan, remove -vulkan from your launch options.
If you chose Vulkan in the video settings, please add -safe_mode to your launch options to allow the game to start with the default rendersystem.
Required Vulkan extension "%s1" is not supported.  Please update your Vulkan driver.
Not Enough Memory For Game
This device does not meet the minimum requirements.
The game requires at least %s1 of device memory to run reliably,
you may not be able to complete a game on this device.
The device appears to have %s2 of memory.
Unsupported Windows Version
This version of Windows is not supported, please upgrade to a newer version
